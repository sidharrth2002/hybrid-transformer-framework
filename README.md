### Abstract
In this work, we present a novel industrial text scoring engine that processes, scores and classifies text documents using a hybrid Longformer model. We employ word-level attention as a mechanism to inject rubrics into a neural model, that is otherwise a black box. Pioneered training on a large corpus of annual reports places our hybrid transformer framework superior to both naive and hierarchical LSTMs, while subsequently introducing the first combination of word-level attention with transformers.
