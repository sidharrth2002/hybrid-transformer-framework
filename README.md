### Abstract
Academic scoring is mainly explored through the pedagogical fields of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) and Short Answer Scoring (SAS), but text scoring in other domains has received limited attention. This paper focuses on industrial text scoring, namely the processing and adherence checking of long annual reports based on regulatory requirements. To lay the foundations for non-academic scoring, a pioneering corpus of annual reports from Malaysian listed companies is scraped, segmented into sections, and domain experts score relevant sections based on adherence. Subsequently, deep neural non-hierarchical attention-based LSTMs, hierarchical attention networks and longformer-based models are refined and evaluated. Since the longformer outperformed LSTM-based models, we embed it into a hybrid scoring framework that employs lexicon and named entity features, with rubric injection via word-level attention, culminating in a Kappa score of 0.956 and 0.811 in both our corpora, respectively. Though scoring is fundamentally subjective, our proposed models show significant results when navigating thin rubric boundaries and handling adversarial responses. As our work proposes a novel industrial text scoring engine, we hope to validate our framework using more official documentation based on a broader range of regulatory practices, both in Malaysia and the securities commissions of other nations.

<p align="center"><i>Our hybrid proposal consists of blocks A, B and C.</i></p>

#### Block A (Neural Model)

Block A can either be (i) Non-hierarchical LSTM, (ii) Hierarchical LSTM or (iii) Longformer. (i) and (ii) are traditional RNNs, and (iii) is a transformer. We aim to choose the best of the three architectures.

1. <b>Non-hierarchical LSTM</b> - As the naive baseline, this model is based on the architecture of Taghipour. It consists of word tokenization, 300-dimensional pre-trained GLoVE embeddings, a convolutional layer for n-gram level feature extraction, an LSTM layer, pooling of LSTM states via mean-over-time or attention, followed by a 32-cell FCL, and another FCL with either a discrete softmax (classification) or scalar sigmoid (regression) activation. We replicate the same attention layer implementation of Taghipour, which involves the learning of an attention vector signifying the importance of each time step.

2. <b>Hierarchical LSTM</b> - While non-hierarchical LSTMs model text in a linear sequence, hierarchical LSTMs first split the text into sentences, and then words, resulting in a 3-dimensional input vector <i>(batch size, num sentences, num words)</i>. The word and sentence encoders can either be convolutions or LSTMs. Hence, our experiments test permutations of different encoders at both levels.

3. <b>Longformer</b> - To handle sequences of text longer than 512 words, we employ the Longformer model. By introducing a dilated sliding window and combining local and global attention, the Longformer can handle sequence lengths of up to 4096 words, pre-trained on autoregressive language modelling tasks. While the Longformer is not the state-of-the-art, we contend that it stands on the balance between fast computations and performance compared to RoBERTA and BigBird. Our longformer-based model consists of tokenization, Longformer block embeddings (finetuned), dropout and FCL.

#### Block B (NLP Features)

Block B is a module that processes the categorical presence of domain-specific lexicons and the numerical count of selected named entity families. This is based on the understanding that more detailed responses will make mention of relevant n-grams and named entities in their description. We use the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) ranking of n-grams in the lemmatized corpus along with Spacy's rule-based PhraseMatcher to select and mark the 30 most meaningful lexicons, while using StanfordNLP's NER tagger to annotate the corpus before counting the frequency of each NER family (organisations, laws, persons) in each response. A Support Vector Classifier is used with Recursive Feature Elimination to identify handcrafted features that most impact the final score. The numerical features are transformed using a quantile normal distribution, and categorical features are one-hot encoded.

#### Block C (Rubric Word-level Attention)
Based on the work of Chen et al. and Wang et al., we compute the attentional similarity between expert-defined keywords (that one can expect a high-scoring response to use) and the response. The careful selection of phrases allows the injection of scoring rubrics into the model.

For a response $r$ with $n$ words and key phrase $k$ with $m$ words, GLoVE word embedding sequences $\{e_{1}^{r}, e_{2}^{r}, e_{3}^{r},...,e_{n}^{r} \}$ and $\{e_{1}^{k}, e_{2}^{k}, e_{3}^{k},...,e_{m}^{k} \}$ are respectively generated.

1. The dot product of the two sequences is computed.
    ```math
        z_{i,j} = e_{i}^{k} \cdot e_{j}^{r}
    ```
2. Softmax is computed over the rows and columns of the matrix to obtain $\alpha_{i}^{k}$ and $\alpha_{j}^{r}$, where $\alpha_{i}^{k}$ intuitively signifies the attention that the word $i$ in the key phrase pays to every word in $a$.
    ```math
        \{\alpha_{i}^{k} = softmax(z_{i, 1}, ..., z_{i, n}), \ \alpha_{j}^{a} = softmax(z_{1, j}, ..., z_{m, j})\}
    ```

3. Attentional vectors are computed based on $\alpha_{i}^{k}$ and $\alpha_{j}^{a}$ using a weighted sum for both key phrase to response and response to key phrase.
    ```math
        \{u = \frac{1}{m} \sum \sum \alpha_{i,j}^{k} e_{j}^{r}, \ v = \frac{1}{n} \sum \sum \alpha_{j,i}^{r} e_{i}^{k}\}
    ```
4. A feature vector $f_{k} = [u;v]$ is output for $k$ key elements before being concatenated into an overall word-level attention vector $f=[f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3}, ... f_{k}]$.

#### Combining Module for Multimodal Amalgamation
The outputs of blocks B and C are combined with the logits output of the neural block either via an (a) attention sum or (b) an MLP. The attention sum adds the Longformer outputs, categorical and numerical features and the word-level attention feature vector, before the Longformer outputs query the result vector. For example, if $F$ is the final feature vector, $W$ is the weight matrix, $x$ is the longformer's text features, $c$ represents categorical features, $n$ represents numerical, and $w$ represents attentional features, the total features $F$ and attention $\alpha_{i,j}$ are:

```math
        F=\alpha_{x,x}W_{x}x+\alpha_{x,c}W_{c}c+\alpha_{x,n}W_{n}n+\alpha_{x,w}W_{w}w
```

```math
        \alpha_{i,j} = \frac{exp(LeakyReLU(a^{T}[W_{i}x_{i}||W_{j}x_{j}]))}{\sum_{k\in\{x,c,n,w\}}exp(LeakyReLU(a^{T}[W_{i}x_{i}||W_{k}x_{k}]))}
```
