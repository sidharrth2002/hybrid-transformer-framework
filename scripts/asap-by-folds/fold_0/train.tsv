5994	9550	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is Finally comfortable with her new “home.” After the passage is mostly a reflection of Saeng’s old life, it ends this way to signify that she has become accustomed to her new way of life. For example, it says “in the spring, and the geese return…” that shows that she is now used to the geese and the nature of her new world. The author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release. Saeng had so many memories locked inside her old life, that she couldn’t grasp new ones in her new home. The authors use of this paragraph is a good way to close out the story because it lets the reader feel the relaxed scene of the birds flying away; Saeng escaping  her pain and becoming  a real part of her new world.	2	3		3																						153	5	166	4	0	0	4.108974358974359	31.2	39	22	16	6	3	16	81	13.6	7.09	8.15	16	11.7	14.07	14.25	10.8	197
6005	9561	4	In “Winter Hibiscus,” by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. “…in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words.	2	2		2																						101	5	114	9	0	0	4.352941176470588	20.4	25	16	9	4	3	18	58	11.9	7.67	8.02	13	9.6	11.31	13.75	9.5	132
6014	9570	4	The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that.	2	2		2																						116	4	121	1	0	0	3.9741379310344827	29.0	17	23	2	6	7	6	76	11.8	6.11	6.57	5	8.7	11.94	17.0	6.0	131

The author ended the story with this excerpt, ”When they come back, ‘Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The reason for this is so she will have time to adjust. Saeng just needs a little comforting because all of this is new to her. This words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself, “Almost familiar to her now. Like geese."""	2	1		2																						94	6	106	6	0	0	4.574468085106383	15.666666666666666	21	12	7	6	2	18	52	11.8	8.77	7.49	11	10.1	11.53	13.25	10.1	127

The way she speaks of the test shows her determination.

The author shows that Saeng will relate to the blooms or the hybiscus plant and take the test again. The author does this to leave a clif haber and it shows there is more to Saeng’s life but it is still to come. In the story Saeng is trys to get used to change and that she is have a hard time.

6052	9608	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng , was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,’’ I think Saeng’s mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng Its almost as if she’s saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change likes anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try hander to pass it next time. Saeng  isn’t going to give up and she’ll keep holding on to make it through Saeng knows it’s hard to adjust to changes to life’s but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, she’ll be able to get situated in this new place.	2	3		3																						156	5	169	10	0	0	4.2993630573248405	31.4	33	29	11	10	8	23	85	18.4	8.02	8.52	13	13.7	16.29	26.0	8.1	190
6055	9611	4	The Hibiscus is budding means that the flower was growing. That is a flower with lots of bright colors and nothing else can beat it. The reason another flower can’t beat it is because that flower represents so much thing and it is one of the most natural born flowers around.	1	1		1																						51	3	54	0	0	0	4.411764705882353	17.0	10	7	3	5	2	4	31	7.8	7.65	7.27	7	7.6	9.15	8.833333333333334	9.7	70

However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."	2	2		2																						178	9	196	10	0	0	4.550561797752809	19.77777777777778	47	31	12	10	4	25	97	9.9	8.41	7.81	23	8.7	10.17	10.333333333333334	10.7	243
6062	9618	4	The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driver’s test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, “aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. “Through the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. “The pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered,”, “The winter hibiscus’ was in the ground now”, and, “overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and – yes – Familiar to Saeng now.” This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saeng’s newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to thrive in it.	3	3		3																						237	12	254	9	0	0	4.30801687763713	19.75	58	25	22	15	9	27	123	15.8	7.85	7.92	26	13.0	15.25	18.0	11.5	299
6066	9622	4	The  last  paragraph of the story.” Winter Hibiscus by Minfong  Ho is important to the story. The last paragraph leaves a definite ending so the  reader  knows  exactly what is going to happen  in the future.  This  paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represent s symbols in the story. The author concludes the hibiscus is important to her. Along with the hibiscus it also shows that the  geese  and the melting of the snow represent a fresh  start  and a new  beginning . These symbols  are  important  to her in that they  give  her a chance to start over and she sees that in the  winter  hibiscus.	2	2		2																						112	6	138	0	0	0	3.887218045112782	22.166666666666668	27	11	11	3	3	8	64	10.7	8.3	7.01	11	11.9	10.68	10.333333333333334	12.3	183

6069	9625	4	"I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says,”when the snows melt and the geese return” this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, “when this hibiscus is budding,""  and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam.  Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement."	3	2		3																						150	6	168	10	0	0	4.342105263157895	25.333333333333332	34	23	6	10	6	18	88	14.2	8.08	7.44	15	11.5	13.33	11.2	10.4	195

6110	9666	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because everything in the story will repeat such as the season changes and you will not be able to plant nor grow in the winter. For example she talked about how the plants are nothing like her home, but she has to adapt to the fact she’s not home, & adjust to her environment. I say this because if she doesnt she will just be an unhappen person worrying about where she came from.	1	1		1																						82	3	88	2	0	0	4.2926829268292686	27.333333333333332	13	12	3	3	4	6	54	12.6	7.78	7.51	8	10.3	12.78	15.333333333333334	10.5	107

6114	9670	4	This was a very interesting story and it snowed all the hardships this young girl has gone through, the author ended it in a very interesting way. When they ended the story I thought to myself how nice it ended. If think the author did a very nice job. She made it so that she snowed all the hard ships that Saeng had gone through, as if they were the harsh winter. Then as the author said, “as the snow melts away;…”,I think this shows how even though Saeng  problems seem never ending and harsh, that one day they will be gone and things will become beautiful again, like the flower budding. In the spring time. Also she did a nice job because throughout the story I could feel her pain. I felt as if I was there with her because of her use of descriptive  words like, “exploding, shock ,intense” and others to describe how much of a sudden was everything was. Then when she ended it, it was like she was showing us Saeng’s hope for a better future, even though things aren’t the way they were back home!	2	3		3																						192	9	215	11	1	0	4.184615384615385	21.666666666666668	34	28	14	16	4	26	117	9.2	6.67	6.5	11	6.9	8.94	10.4	7.8	237

6125	9682	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind because she found  a  flower that reminds her of homeland. She is afraid that her parents  are going to be mad at for not passing the test, therefore she  buys  a  flower  that she sees for it remind. When she gets home and telling her mom how much she paid for the flower  and  how  she  didn’t  pass, mother is upset for only a second, then she is understanding of what her  daughter is going throgh.

6127	9684	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again. The author wants to tell the reader because she fail the test she know what she did wrong and shes going to correct. For example when Saeng said, “then I will take that test again.” Saeng feel sorry she fail a simple test so she wants to retake the test when the snow melts.	1	1		1																						75	5	80	1	0	0	4.1866666666666665	15.0	18	17	2	2	1	7	39	10.8	6.91	6.56	4	8.3	10.53	12.833333333333334	6.4	91
6133	9690	4	Why I think the auther concludes the last paragraph in the story because it's kind of like a moral to the story.

6138	9695	4	The Author ends the story off with that paragraph because when dealing with flowers and nature. Then are seasons  when the flowers don’t  come up like winter for example. The paragraph is saying in the spring when the winter is over she tells her self that she will look forward to seeing all the plant that nature has to give.	0	0		0																						60	3	65	0	0	0	4.32258064516129	20.666666666666668	15	10	0	2	1	5	35	9.4	8.12	7.52	7	7.6	8.67	10.333333333333334	6.4	80
6142	9699	4	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. This is done to symbolize the many things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were “strange before [and] had become familiar to her now”. The hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed. The last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learnt.	2	2		2																						130	6	147	9	0	0	4.7153846153846155	21.666666666666668	31	23	9	2	7	19	75	10.1	9.28	7.6	19	8.2	10.52	10.166666666666666	11.2	180
6165	9722	4	The auther concluded the story with this because just like the flower it will come back a new, and so will she. The flower represents determination, using the flower to show her own determination. Even though she failed her drivers test she still has determination to take it, and try to pass again. Even with failur she is determained to get over it. Just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back. Saeng is frogeting her failure and coming back a new.	2	2		2																						87	6	96	3	0	0	4.517241379310345	14.5	15	17	3	10	4	14	56	7.1	7.71	7.08	12	6.6	8.1	7.416666666666666	9.3	122
6167	9724	4	In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment.	2	3		3																						168	8	176	0	0	0	4.208333333333333	21.0	45	30	7	5	3	15	94	10.4	7.09	7.83	16	7.9	11.03	13.5	8.4	209
6168	9725	4	The author puts that excerpt into the text to show the reader that she had made a mistake an will fix it in the future. I believe the other put it in  for that reason because in the text Saeng began to cry when she admitted to her mother that she failed the test. This shows that she was really upset by the fact she failed an hopes to improve in the near future. Another reason why I believe ‘the author concludes the story like this is to lead the reader on to believe Saeng is going to get over beign home sick.	1	1		1																						103	4	108	0	0	0	3.9615384615384617	26.0	21	20	3	1	0	7	62	10.2	5.93	6.6	4	9.8	10.71	13.25	8.1	133
6171	9728	4	There is why the author ended the story with this paragraph. It mean that when she comes back after winter she will repeat her tasks all over. For example she will dig, sen flowers, their customers. Then when winter comes again she will do it all over. So has steally the other is using different words to say when winter ends she will repeat her actions. That is why the author ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																						77	6	85	2	0	0	4.402597402597403	12.833333333333334	16	13	2	9	0	7	50	5.7	6.77	6.94	8	4.7	5.64	5.75	6.4	101
6174	9731	4	I think that the author ends this story with that paragraph to some up what the story was all about and to also say that Saeng would try the test again. In the story it says “she realised that many of the thing that she had thought of as strange before had become, though the quiet repetition of season opon reason, almost familiar to her now and this last paragraph help bring all this together.	1	2		2																						75	2	79	2	0	0	4.293333333333333	37.5	14	9	5	8	2	7	50	17.5	7.9	7.18	4	14.4	16.07	20.25	0.0	96
6177	9734	4	She failed the test at the same day that she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her. The plant represents her home, where she used to live and the geese could represent how they are moving on in life, over coming the obstacles of cold weather, and snow to move on to something better most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her. So she wanted to take it again, around the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels thot since she failed, she should start over.	2	2		2																						116	6	128	5	0	0	4.112068965517241	19.333333333333332	18	19	8	9	5	10	72	7.6	5.98	6.23	7	6.1	8.75	11.2	8.8	138
6179	9736	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting.	0	0		0																						84	2	92	7	0	0	4.488095238095238	42.0	18	15	4	6	3	11	46	20.7	9.01	8.54	9	15.0	17.75	22.5	0.0	104
6184	9741	4	The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over, she will start over too. In the essay Saeng, the young girl says, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” @CAPS1 Saeng failed the test the first time, She is going to wait until spring so that she can have a fresh start. In the essay, the “winter hibiscus” reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in @LOCATION1. This at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time. Her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her driver’s test again in the spring.	2	3		3																						164	7	178	8	0	0	4.347560975609756	23.428571428571427	36	26	10	10	7	20	95	12.7	7.61	7.21	12	9.2	12.14	17.333333333333332	10.1	201

6194	9751	4	I think the author adds the last paragraph because the story could use a little part about Saeng. And what she is planning to do next. Also the author @MONTH1 have added that paragraph because she was maybe thinking about writing a second story of winter Hibiscus, and they wanted to write a part that could be about in the next story. It would make you wonder that if she does take the test again would she pass it this time after the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. I think this @MONTH1 be why the author added this paragraph in the story.	1	1		1																						107	5	114	2	0	0	4.308411214953271	21.4	23	17	5	4	3	7	68	9.6	7.2	6.32	7	8.1	8.93	10.4	6.7	137
6195	9752	4	I think the author concluded the Story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First, when saeng first saw the hibiscus, she was sad, but after seeing the flower, she got happy. Next, her mother helps her plant it and saeng is sure it'll be there in spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since she has reflected on her past	1	1		1																						60	4	70	6	0	0	4.583333333333333	15.0	12	10	4	7	2	10	33	7.6	7.76	6.75	4	5.6	8.67	7.75	9.5	79
6206	9763	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter the hibiscuses are dying. Also she is leaving and wont come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, and she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																						68	4	74	1	0	0	4.382352941176471	17.0	14	9	0	8	2	6	43	7.7	7.42	6.57	6	6.4	8.56	8.25	8.1	89
6207	9764	4	The reason the author of “Winter hibiscus” ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end  of a moderatly depressing story. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving foreward.  And that the end of your world comes when you make it so. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end.	2	1		2																						79	5	86	0	0	0	3.888888888888889	16.2	17	12	5	4	1	8	50	7.1	5.34	6.42	6	7.5	9.44	7.699999999999999	8.8	101

6221	9778	4	The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower. It’s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus.	1	1		1																						35	2	37	0	0	0	4.2	17.5	8	7	1	3	2	4	20	7.4	7.02	7.73	3	6.4	7.98	8.25	0.0	43
6229	9786	4	The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and relizes what it symbolizes to her. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscas herself so that she holds the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this manner.	1	1		1																						65	4	69	0	0	0	4.415384615384616	16.25	12	13	0	3	1	7	40	10.2	7.95	8.36	11	9.4	11.76	13.166666666666666	11.9	91

6241	9798	4	The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a vowe to herself because it shows how important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her determination because it reminds her of home. Saeng says “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The hibiscus flower gives her confidence. It reminds her of her home in Vietnam before they moved to @LOCATION2. Therefore, the author concludes the story with that certain paragraph because it symbolizes the importance of the flower.	2	1		2																						93	6	102	3	0	0	4.829787234042553	15.666666666666666	28	13	2	2	1	13	50	10.8	10.33	8.12	14	9.4	10.45	11.5	11.6	141
6259	9816	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says “In the spring when the snows melt” because she is beginning to get used to “the quiet repetition of season upon season”. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.	2	2		2																						118	6	126	3	0	0	4.61864406779661	19.666666666666668	28	17	11	1	2	14	66	12.1	9.35	7.35	12	10.1	12.49	12.0	12.3	166
6265	9822	4	In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driving test again in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings to her. She describes peaceful things in nature, like the geese and hibiscus, that she draws strength from because they remind her to her homeland. In this way, she’ll always have a little piece of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng relates to nature and pulls strength from it. Her mother has a garden, and she relates to it in that she has a different past, preferring natural foods like bitter melons over @LOCATION1. This final paragraph shows the hope that the beautiful nature from her homeland has brought to Saeng, helping her adapt to living in a new place.	2	3		3																						139	7	154	8	0	0	4.618705035971223	19.857142857142858	35	21	10	2	3	15	77	10.3	8.82	7.58	15	7.5	9.11	7.5	8.4	183

6277	9834	4	I think Saeng need to take the test over because to get her grade up. Saeng be waring about the snow, in the spirng because she is think about the flower getting cover over it.

6278	9835	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she’s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she’s not giving up “…then I will take that teat again” which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																						72	4	77	0	0	0	4.315068493150685	18.25	18	14	1	3	0	8	40	8.2	7.48	6.72	7	6.8	8.31	8.5	7.2	91

IN THE PHRASE, ""WHEN THEY COME BACK"" THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY REFERS TO THE HIBISCUS FLOWERS THAT REPRESENT THE FOND MEMORIES OF HER HOMELAND. THE AUTHOR ILLUSTRATES SAENG'S STRUGGLE ADAPTING TO HER NEW LIFE THROUGH A “TEST” OF PLANTING THE BUDS JUST AS SHE HAD DONE BACK HOME WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. THIS TEST REPRESENTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ADAPTATION TO HER NEW LIFE.

6290	9847	4	The author decided to conclude the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new life. In the third paragraph on the second page the author writes, “Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile… That atleast, she could hold onto.” After failing her driver’s test Saeng was feeling foreign and alone. She desperately looked to the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned. After a discussion with her mother Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings. By concluding the story, with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must “blossom” in her new home in order to do well. She still needs time for this, as the flowers needs time to plant its roots into the ground.	3	3		3																						162	7	179	9	0	0	4.638036809815951	23.285714285714285	41	24	11	8	3	23	86	12.1	9.46	8.0	23	8.8	11.71	11.4	10.0	216
6293	9850	4	The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience.	1	1		1																						82	4	87	0	0	0	4.475609756097561	20.5	19	16	5	4	2	7	45	9.9	8.3	7.93	12	8.9	9.66	11.25	8.8	111
6294	9851	4	Well I think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her her attitude better known now she is changing so she is going to put her mind to whatever she has to do and she is going to take the test again with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away.	1	1		1																						59	2	60	0	0	0	3.864406779661017	29.5	8	12	0	5	2	1	39	26.3	5.94	8.17	5	21.6	24.96	31.5	0.0	72

The story shows the many difficulties saeng faces when leaving her old home and comming to her new one. In the day described. She failes a drivers test, doesn’t eat lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old home. Also, this paragraph shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes her. The plant is not in its native home, faces many difficulties; the cold its small pot, and even its general surrounding.

6310	9867	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did, because Saeng is a nature freak.

6329	9886	4	The author views the hibiscus plant as a new start.

6332	9889	4	I believe that she included this because she wanted to show important it was to her. For example when she says in the spring she will take the test again. I think that ment she will work harder to make sure she does everything right. So that she can say she follows through on things that are important to her.

6338	9895	4	The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simpley set a time for her to try again.

6362	9919	4	The author concludes  with this paragraph, to give a sense at hope and growth. The flower represents Saeng’s  homelard, and it makes her feel comforted. It connects her with her emotions and reminds her of the way are. The growth and flourishing of the hibiscus corresponds to the flourish of Saeng. When it blooms, she will have a true piece of home with her, and  will be able to take the test again. The story  is  about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change.

6369	9926	4	The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to set the final mood. The author wanted to show that Saeng will not give up and she will continue to adapt to her new surroundings. It made the end of the story feel warm and it also inspired. The end of the story encourages the reader to not give up as well. The last paragraph sets an example of how the reader can vow to improve as well. The author knew that the last paragraph would stand as an inspiration and mabe help a reader going through something similar to the story.	1	1		1																						102	6	108	0	0	0	4.264705882352941	17.0	21	19	7	5	3	6	62	7.1	6.84	7.11	11	6.4	9.15	8.333333333333334	8.8	136

6378	9935	4	The author concluded the story with saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. When walking home from her test, Saeng saw a familiar flower and chose to make a delar to a flower shop. There, she saw many flowers that reminded her of home. she bought a hibiscus and went home. Her and her mother planted it, after saeng realized the flower could make it through the winter. She looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she realized that she has adapted to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus gave courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue surviving in @LOCATION1.	2	2		2																						142	8	153	3	0	0	4.429577464788732	17.75	31	33	4	4	7	10	78	9.6	7.83	7.53	20	8.8	10.37	8.666666666666666	10.9	192
6380	9937	4	The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and strgging to survive and fit in in it’s non-natve land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported through out the story when her mother connents on the hibiscus by the late. She says, “It’s strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matter” (Ho @NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saeng’s life. Both must be strong fight through hard imes where no, one, “not even her class mates or frends, or Mrs. Lambert” (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, shes promising herself she will fight through the hard times grow strong, just as her winter hibiscus.	3	3		3																						167	8	193	10	0	0	4.526946107784431	20.875	43	22	13	13	4	32	93	9.2	8.07	7.3	14	5.8	8.88	8.333333333333334	8.8	208
6383	9940	4	The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way.	2	2		2																						73	5	78	0	0	0	4.726027397260274	14.6	17	11	5	4	5	5	41	8.1	9.16	7.39	11	6.6	8.58	8.1	10.8	103

6400	9957	4	After reading ”Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. I believe Ho ended the story with that paragraph to support her idea of overcoming  obstacles. First after failing her driving test, Saeng was very upset and didn’t know if she would ever pass it. But after seeing a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her home in Vietnam which inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive. But, after seeing how the plant brought joy to Saeng, her mother forgave her. Last when saeng was digging a hole to let the hibiscus grow, it inspired Saeng to take the test again because she overcame the obstacles of brining the plant home and letting it grow. Therefore, I believe Ho end “Winter Hibiscus”, to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles.	2	2		2																						139	8	157	9	0	0	4.642857142857143	17.5	33	28	7	7	4	21	72	9.3	8.81	6.89	18	7.7	8.4	7.142857142857142	9.8	199

I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her com fort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", This implies a new beginning so the hibiscus is representing Saeng.

Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in “a blink.” Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her.

6418	9975	4	The reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought. Also it symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says, “... this hibiscus is budding ...” (Ho @NUM1). She is also describing that they will start over when spring comes. And that leaves the reader with the last thought about Saeng, and how she has overcome living in the new place. Lastly, it ties up @CAPS1 feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved, “... I will take the test again” (Ho @NUM1), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot.

6422	9979	4	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test.

Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.	2	2		2																						82	4	88	2	0	0	4.463414634146342	20.5	18	13	2	2	0	6	51	9.8	8.18	7.16	10	7.7	9.66	11.5	9.5	109

For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus wasn’t the same as the one in her homeland.

6431	9988	4	The author Minfong Ho ends the story talking about the test Saeng failed and vowing to take it again because like in the story the test was symbolizing like slightly moving on, just kind of starting her newlife and not living in the old. But Saeng couldnt do that. She bought the flower with all her money because it held memories for her. But I think as the story goes on she kind of realizes she can have both, her old and new life. I think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again.

6470	10027	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. It’s just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring.

6475	10032	4	In the story “winter hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, it tells of a girl who just moved to a new country & is having a hard time adapting to the new land & its people. But I think the author put that quote at the end to lead you to believe to never give up, there is a new beginning & you will make it. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her.” This shows that has finally has found comfort & is confident, like the geese going to adapt in a new area, & then will come back, & that the winter hibiscus new gives up & will keep living in the new weather conditions every season.	3	2		3																						146	3	158	9	0	0	4.191780821917808	48.666666666666664	27	26	12	8	8	18	78	22.5	8.32	8.09	9	19.0	20.53	18.666666666666668	13.6	196
6477	10034	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new sorrounds. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place. In the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her. The spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming, the geese return, and the snow has melted.

6534	10091	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and her situation in a new country. It shows that Saeng is using the hibiscus and its ability to adapt for inspiration. During the story, Saeng describes how she had always seen the hibiscus at home in her old country. Her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home. But she says it’s because it’s strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the United States. This is what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She might have failed her lisence test, but she used the hibiscus actions to set a goal for herself. The plant will go through a cold, and snowy winter but it will grow and blossom in the spring. Saeng would use that time to study and get ready, and she’ll be confident for the test. The paragraph that the author finishes on shows the connection Saeng made with her situation and the plant’s situation.	2	3		3																						182	10	196	4	0	0	4.4010989010989015	18.2	47	24	11	3	11	16	104	8.4	7.78	6.53	13	6.8	9.04	11.8	10.4	243
6538	10095	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the Saeng's determination to over come the obstacles of her past experience. For example, the story starts out with Saeng taking a ‘test’,  while reliving her memories in the greenhouse, she started to breakdown. ”A wave of loss so deep and story it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" She then buys the plant and takes it home to her mother,telling her that she 'failed'. The mother then becomes understanding and helps Saeng's vow retake the 'test', the narrator emphasizes Saeng’s determination to overcome the troubles of her past and go on with the future."	2	2		2																						106	5	126	5	0	0	4.897196261682243	21.4	33	19	1	7	4	15	57	15.0	10.62	9.72	20	11.3	14.37	15.25	12.6	152
6542	10099	4	I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imagen what happens next once spring rolls around for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their imagenation to connect to the story. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that with that paragraph was to give hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time. It was also a way to end the story in a good note.	2	1		2																						86	4	90	0	0	0	4.22093023255814	21.5	22	13	3	3	0	6	49	9.2	6.91	6.36	7	8.1	9.53	11.5	8.1	113

6551	10108	4	In the story the Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho it explains the obstacles Saeng went through coming to a different country. In this story Saeng had just failed her driving test as she was reminded of her home through some tropical flowers. Moreover the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This part of the story is very important because it examines her growth and hope for change, just us the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a buetiful blossed flower. Furthermore it explains to the each that she will not give up and that she will change to the environment just as th plant lives has and the geese come back to the changed environment. That part of the story is very important for the reader, @CAPS1 it concludes Saeng thoughts and hopes for the future wile adapting to her new enviorment.	3	3		3																						182	6	193	6	0	0	4.521978021978022	30.333333333333332	46	24	10	12	7	19	104	18.1	9.12	8.22	21	13.9	16.54	19.666666666666668	13.0	243

I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there waste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason.

6553	10110	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng said she failed the test, and when spring comes back then she will take the test again. The last paragraph reads “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She really does not tell us what test she is supposed to be taking.	1	1		1																						77	3	84	5	0	0	4.467532467532467	25.666666666666668	16	13	2	7	3	10	46	18.9	8.6	8.01	6	13.6	15.92	20.25	0.0	93

6572	10129	4	The author ended the story with an unconcluded ending. What I mean is the author wrote so that he could keep readers interested so that they would want to read his other books.

6579	10136	4	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel.""

6587	10144	4	The author uses symbolism to convey a different message. Saeng said in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, and then I will take that test again. The author uses the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng gets older like the hibiscus, that then she will be ready to take that test again. The author uses symbolize to convey more of the story.	2	2		2																						69	4	76	3	0	0	4.478260869565218	17.25	17	12	5	4	3	7	37	8.3	7.83	6.78	7	7.7	8.66	10.375	10.7	96

6600	10159	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she misses her home and that affected her driving test. At her home country it was warm and she had all her family memories. In the new country it is cold and snowy, something she isn’t used to. It states she will take the test again when all them things happen because it will feel like her home country and she will be more focused on the test and not what she misses.	1	2		2																						85	4	90	1	0	0	4.223529411764706	21.25	15	12	5	3	5	6	54	9.1	6.85	6.74	7	8.1	9.46	11.375	8.1	107
6603	10162	4	I think the author conclades the story with this paragraph because it sounds hopeful. She wasn’t adapting to her new home very well and that made her feel hopeless.Saeng failed her driving test which only made things worse for her. To make things better, she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home. She found the plant to be very comforting and it helped her get passed the tough times. In the last paaragraph, Saeng is looking forward to the spring so she can retake the test and hopefully pass it this time. I think the paragraph provides a feeling of hopefulness which is way the author concluded the story the way they did.	2	2		2																						116	7	126	2	0	0	4.487179487179487	16.714285714285715	24	22	9	6	3	12	64	9.6	8.53	8.0	15	7.3	9.79	8.166666666666666	9.3	150

6615	10174	4	I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

6640	10199	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is thinking what it will be like when all of this happens.

6641	10200	4	The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to end on a good note and show hope for the future. First, throughout the story Saeng felt lonely and depressed because she missed her home in Vietnam. With all this depression Saeng saw the winter hibiscus that reminded her of her childhood memories. She felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life. The flower represented the light and hope for the future. Next, it shows perserverance factor in the story Saeng fails her drivers test and came home feeling unacomplished. When she says she will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms it shows perserverance and never giving up. Lastly, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and show a positive outlook on life. No matter where you come from with love and perserverance you can overcome any obstacle. Whether it be your school, tests or home with a little hardwork and faith you can achieve.	3	3		3																						173	10	187	4	0	0	4.658959537572255	17.3	50	24	10	6	10	14	89	9.2	8.99	7.87	27	6.5	9.0	7.142857142857142	8.8	233
6649	10208	4	The author concludes the story with the main character vowing to take the drivers test again to symbolize moving forward. “ Saeng felt a shock of recognition so inffuse, it was almost visceral.” A  pone stumbling to a florist shop the main character sees a flower that reminded her of her home land, Vietnam. “Here, let me help, mother.” In relieving  her mother in the task of planting the seed that she had bought she began to mature. After reflecting on the memories of her past and coming to peace with there   there   was nothing left stoping   her from moving  forward. “when   they come back  I will take that test again.” As she sees   geese migrating south for the winter in a v formation she sets a goal for herself and uses that goal as a tool to help herself grow and move foward in the new country she’s in. The main character vowing in “Winter Hibiscus” symbolizes moving   foward.	3	2		3																						160	8	180	4	0	0	4.329411764705882	21.25	36	32	8	11	3	21	79	26.4	9.24	9.34	22	22.9	24.32	29.5	15.5	235

6655	10214	4	At the end of the story, winter Hibiscus, the author's concluding paragraph shows many of the aspects of the story in a summary, Saeng is determined to go back to the drivers test and is open to a new beginning. The author used these concluding words in the paragraph to express the hope in Saeng of a better beginning and to show her determination to pass the drivers test. The author ties the objects in-a story to represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus is a reminder of her glorious home, spring is the time she picks because it is a new beginning, and the geese returning show the determination of her and her to resolve to become new and better.	2	2		2																						124	4	137	6	0	0	4.532258064516129	31.0	37	13	11	1	6	11	71	15.4	9.06	7.98	17	14.2	15.3	16.0	14.9	184
6665	10224	4	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a new country. In this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so. Saeng took a test and failed and in the winter, flowers fail but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms Saeng will ""bloom"" and try the test again.

6668	10227	4	I believe that the author concluded the story “Winter @CAPS1” with the paragraph that she did in order to imply that Saeng will not give up. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was very sad about failing the test, but will take the test again infers that Saeng is a determined person. It is my belief that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the feeling that Saeng was determined despite hardships.	2	1		2																						74	3	78	1	0	0	4.621621621621622	24.666666666666668	18	12	3	2	1	7	42	12.7	9.41	8.49	15	10.6	12.58	14.333333333333334	11.2	103
6677	10236	4	This story about believed in yourself, and never giving up it was a story about perseverance. Saeng really believed she could pass her driver's test, and although she was disappointed with result, she found a way to cope with her loss. The hibiscus that flower means a lot to her because she can connect it to her homeland and, and it is a thing of beauty. something she needed at such an ugly time for her. It's always hard o adapt to a new country in a short period of time. I know what it's like when one small thing goes wrong. You can snap and it will feel a lot worse than it actually is. You feel helpless and alone just like the hibiscus growing next to the highway in the photo. Saeng vowed to take her driver’s test again when her hibiscus would bloom in the spring I think the hibiscus really symbolizes Saeng as a person.	2	3		3																						159	9	175	4	0	0	4.245283018867925	17.666666666666668	32	22	10	8	6	15	97	8.5	6.73	6.71	15	7.5	9.47	11.0	9.8	209

6687	10246	4	The author of this story story created the last paragraph so that it finishes the story with a great ending. The fact of never giving up and try again again and again. The author said, ”I will take the test again.” In the story Saeng said, ”I failed the test” but now that she isn't giving up. This last paragraph makes a lot of senses and is needed to make this story complete. So just as others don't give up in @LOCATION1, Saeng is doing the same and is retaking the test.	1	1		1																						92	6	102	3	0	0	4.173913043478261	15.333333333333334	22	15	5	7	5	11	59	7.4	6.15	6.78	10	6.9	9.1	9.0	8.2	119
6691	10250	4	I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder. I think this because if you put into context the word “test”, it could mean many things. For example it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of her situation. Also it could mean the test to adjust to her new home when the spring comes. That is why I think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph.	1	2		2																						81	5	87	1	0	0	4.185185185185185	16.2	20	14	3	1	0	6	46	6.4	6.26	6.58	9	6.1	7.47	7.5	6.7	105

She just come to the new country and she haven’t adjusted herself to this new country yet. She was disappointed like “mashaft of the war afternoon starlight.” “war” showed saeng was ery upset. After she met the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland she missed it. She felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home. Last she burst into tears again. She missed her homelad very much “snows"" symbolized the difficult situation she had now. But she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. “spring” symbolized the hope to the new life saeng thought things would get better in the spring. She would succeed in the spring. She had the determination to succeed, so the author uses that paragraph at conclusion. It symbolizes hope."	3	2		3																						173	13	190	3	0	0	4.786127167630058	13.307692307692308	42	29	12	12	4	22	96	8.3	9.27	7.27	18	6.5	7.84	8.5	9.5	239

6705	10264	4	The author of winter Hibiscus , Minfong Ho ended the story in this way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough to make it through the winter. That’s what matters. “Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their lives again in @LOCATION1, that @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as pretty, but it will survive, which is what matters. Her words soothe her daughters worries about starting ore. Also, the budding hibiscus could be considered asymbol of rebirth, since it is dying and growing with the seasons.The family is dying in out a @CAPS1 family & being @CAPS2 was an @CAPS3 family. However even though they “died” as a @CAPS1 family, that does not meqan that they have lost their heritage which is why the author end talking about a flower that is both @CAPS1 & @CAPS3 just like Saeng.	3	3		3																						160	9	176	7	0	0	4.565217391304348	17.88888888888889	41	24	2	10	5	28	87	13.7	9.17	8.25	23	11.1	11.24	11.2	11.2	224
6706	10265	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will perservere through the winter and try to adapt to her new lifestyle. Moving to a new country / culture is extremely tough, and Saeng is bad, but she doesn’t  give up on creating a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, “in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,” is one of determination and hope. The entire story Saeng was struggling with adapting to her non of  and memory of her homeland give has a sense of security. The sentence wraps up her emotion and shows how strong she is @CAPS1  could easily give up on their driving test, but she won’t. It is a happy ending for somewhat of a sad story. Furthering the sentence shows Saeng’s dwoton  the her plant. This hibiscus will survive and so will Saeng when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so will Saeng. She will try as hard she can to fit in and enjoy her new life. That plant will help her through it by reminding her of vietnam us will as giving her a companion throughout the winter. The  author would not have chosen a better  conclusion for this story. The conclusion orggos  to a new hope to perservere  and sucede. As a result, the reader is test with a sense of pleasure and a good feeling torwards the story.

6717	10276	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author want to show the readers that Saeng will want to pass her driver licens test. The reason that so the reader show how detirmen Saeng do after the winter The example is that in the story Saeng fail her driver licens and was sad about. The next example is that when she find this flow she know she do it again. This show that the flower help her feel better show that she will do it again.

6722	10281	4	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph because he wants to get across to the reader that that saeng will not give up. Saeng and her family moved from Vietnam, and it has been hard for her to adjust to changes. Saeng really misses her homeland and the flowers that she sees @CAPS1 life. She explains how the winter hibiscus is not the same as the one in Vietnam so she plants this @CAPS1 type of flower and decides to wait till the spring to take the driving test. This shows that saeng wants to plant her difficulties in @LOCATION2 and think of them again in the spring when the weather and atmosphere is nice. She is not siving up but she does not want to take the difficulties till a later time. That is why the author concluded with this paragraph.	3	2		3																						145	7	153	1	0	0	4.393103448275862	20.714285714285715	33	22	6	2	7	14	88	9.6	7.78	7.49	18	7.8	9.66	10.8	9.6	190

6739	10298	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” probably chose to end the story that way because then it’s ending with a sense of hope. Also, it is showing how Saeng is adapting to her surroundings much like the winter hibiscus. In the second last paragraph, Saeng hears the hanks of the geese and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her through the course of the time Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because the time would allow her to grow and adapt even more. The hibiscus will be budding then, a sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adopting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could look to the plant for inspiration. This feeling of hope in Saeng and her future is left in the last paragraph, which is why the story ends there.	2	3		3																						147	7	159	5	0	0	4.45578231292517	21.0	34	21	8	9	4	15	85	10.1	8.07	7.36	19	7.9	10.3	14.25	10.3	195
6741	10300	4	I think that in the story “Winter Hibiscus” was a good story and also the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was like to work hard and that is why it mentions at the way end “I will take the test again” so you don’t fall and stay down you work hard and get back up and try again.	1	1		1																						64	1	65	0	0	0	3.765625	64.0	12	11	4	6	5	6	37	28.3	5.36	8.54	3	23.5	26.23	33.0	0.0	74
6743	10302	4	The story is somewhat sad. The girl misses her homeland. She is also sad because she failed her driving test. The author I think ends the story with the girl saying she will take the test again, to show that even though she is sad about her country and failing she is not going to give up. Failing a test especially a driving test stinks. Your very excited to get it but then you don’t. So the author is trying to show that despite the girls sadness she will not give up. The girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes. Also the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note you usually don’t want to leave a story sad with no solution. So she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons why the author ended the way she did but above are the more obvious.	2	2		2																						154	12	166	1	0	0	4.14935064935065	12.833333333333334	25	31	8	17	3	12	94	5.1	5.73	6.79	18	5.2	7.16	5.5	8.0	201

This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life. This also says she has precision, she will continue to try to get her license because she says, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.""

6758	10317	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is going to try keep her next plant. The reason why she says she is going to take the test again because she sold the plant to somebody. Saeng has seed the plant before as a child and that's why she was so attached to it. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will try and keep her next plant.	1	1		1																						75	4	81	1	0	0	4.346666666666667	18.75	18	12	2	2	2	5	48	8.4	7.49	5.83	4	7.1	8.05	8.625	6.0	94
6759	10318	4	The author concludes the last paragraph to show that after a time period you can come back and try something again. Or maybe when weather change this can be different for Saeng. Maybe she is relating herself to the plant as to when it come to spring  the flower will be stronger, and she feel that she will pass the test second time around when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. And it also shows how she appriate the nature because if not, why would she wait until spring and when the snow is melting. The conclusion of the story is that she do like nature, because she talk about the hibiscus.	1	2		2																						115	5	124	3	0	0	4.275862068965517	23.2	20	17	4	7	6	10	74	10.3	7.55	6.56	10	8.7	10.94	14.0	9.9	148

6779	10338	4	The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions.	3	2		3																						174	11	186	0	0	0	4.005714285714285	15.909090909090908	29	27	15	9	3	13	112	6.2	5.33	6.22	12	5.4	8.11	7.833333333333334	7.9	212

She is stressed about failing the driver’s test, country, but it is and she realizes that  nothing is  the same. Except for  one thing  that  she  quickly  recognized. A  plant called the “Winter Hibiscus.”It made her think of her old life in Vietnam. It helped her  set  through  hard  times  and she didn’t want to give up on anythings.This is exactly why Minfong Ho ends the  last paragraph  by stating  that Saeng  will retry  the driving test when the hibiscus is budding.The  flower gives her a thought of home   in  Vietnam, making her try and try again.Also,the author  ends the  story  like   this  to  state a  theme.

But in the story it talks about. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it So I think that they take care of there garden and try to make it live in the winter. So thats what I think about the last paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”	1	1		1																						139	8	152	7	0	0	4.215827338129497	17.375	24	25	3	13	8	12	86	15.8	7.21	7.29	9	12.1	14.5	17.333333333333332	8.1	164

6807	10366	4	The auther concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. first, The test is important to Saeng so that she can prove to herself that she is able to pass it. Ending with this paragraph also gives the reader some suspense as to wheather Saeng will pass or even go to take the test again. Lastly, this paragraph shows Saeng’s personality traits. It shows that she is persistent, determined, and strong willed.	2	1		2																						74	5	83	4	0	0	4.675675675675675	14.8	15	12	6	5	2	12	43	9.9	9.11	7.97	9	7.0	9.02	10.25	8.8	97
6813	10372	4	The “Winter Hibiscus” is a realativly sad, but hopeful story that uses lots of symbols. The author concluded the story with a confident ending that makes the reader feel satisfied. The two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring. “Winter Hibiscus” ends with a hopeful tone thanks to the confident vow Saeng silently makes. She had a rough day, and the author wanted to make sure she had something to look as a goal. It also reveals how strong of a person Saeng is. The author uses this conclusion paragraph to leave the reader with a hopeful and confident tone. The second reason the author concluded with that conclusion paragraph was to relate some of the objects she sees to the spring. The geese represent the new place she is living in, and the hibiscus represents her old home. This paragraph links these two symbols together, so the reader can relate them to the spring. The way the author concluded the story was brillantly done. It represents a hopeful tone, and symbols that relate to spring. It ends confidently, and leaves the reader satisfied.	2	3		3																						200	13	219	6	0	0	4.715	15.384615384615385	52	33	18	5	7	20	99	9.1	9.22	6.6	19	8.6	8.68	11.6	10.7	290
6814	10373	4	I think author concludes the with this paragraph because she wants to not give up. For example, he wants to show  us never give up at anything even if you fail. Therefore, that’s why he ends like that.	1	1		1																						38	3	44	2	0	0	4.205128205128205	13.0	3	9	0	3	0	7	27	5.1	5.96	7.18	4	4.7	6.13	5.666666666666667	6.4	48
6825	10384	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring it’s warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.	0	0		0																						69	2	71	0	0	0	4.188405797101449	34.5	16	9	2	3	2	3	41	15.6	7.44	7.41	5	13.2	15.54	19.25	0.0	87

6832	10391	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he things when the flowers come back they would be batter.

6838	10397	4	There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, she will have many more reasons to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year. She had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing @CAPS1 new beginning that she will have to go through the next year.	2	3		3																						255	15	273	3	0	0	4.352941176470588	17.0	43	54	21	9	2	14	157	7.6	7.25	6.52	23	6.4	8.21	7.2857142857142865	8.8	322
6839	10398	4	I think the author concludes the story with the phase “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” I there saying that they will be ready for them the next time they come back.	0	0		0																						58	2	63	4	0	0	4.293103448275862	29.0	11	9	3	5	2	8	35	27.8	8.03	8.96	5	21.2	23.89	30.0	0.0	68
6841	10400	4	The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a little. For example when Saeng said that she ment when the plants came back. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on two, rather than staping on talking about the v or geese to get the reader off topic. Last she also ment when the geese came back.	0	0		0																						64	4	70	2	0	0	4.1875	16.0	11	13	4	5	1	8	40	6.3	6.15	6.65	5	6.0	7.03	7.25	6.0	80
6843	10402	4	I think the author ended the story with that phrase to show that she wont give up; no matter how hard it is she keeps trying. The girl says in the story “I failed the test,” and then at the end of the story says I will take that test again so she is not willing to fail forever. I also think the author ended the story with that paragraph to make you wonder if she will ever pass the test.	1	1		1																						81	3	86	1	0	0	3.814814814814815	27.0	13	16	1	8	1	6	50	10.0	4.77	6.73	4	9.1	11.29	13.833333333333334	6.4	98
6850	10409	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng, like the geese and the hibiscus, will return again and have hope. Saeng is a little depressed in the story because she is in a new country, and just failed her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back painful emotional memories for her, but at the same time, s very comforting. Later in the story, she plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother. As her mother goes inside, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead. “Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Like the geese.” Saeng knew the geese would return in the spring, just like she would to her driving test. The hibiscus would be in bloom again too to provide her with hope. This is what the final paragraph in the story “winter hibiscus” means.	3	2		3																						166	9	188	11	0	0	4.686746987951807	18.444444444444443	37	20	16	15	4	25	90	11.0	9.11	6.86	16	9.0	10.25	11.6	10.1	226
6852	10411	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.	3	3		3																						204	7	214	4	0	0	4.6568627450980395	29.142857142857142	46	27	14	9	13	20	118	17.5	9.88	8.5	27	14.2	16.54	18.666666666666668	13.3	286
6861	10421	4	I believe the author concludes the that passage in the story to show patintions. Saeng was to wait for spring maybe it will feel like her home town again. She likes the spring better than the winter. She likes the birds the geese return in sping. They go away in winter. That way I believe the author concludes that passage.	1	1		1																						60	6	66	0	0	0	4.416666666666667	10.0	17	10	1	4	0	6	30	4.4	6.3	5.97	4	3.7	4.67	4.166666666666667	5.5	76

She does this I think because she needs time to just think things through to just remember back home and to make a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is just like Saeng.

6884	10444	4	The author concludes the story with they paragraph that they did because it's about the same thing that they opened the story with.  To introduce the story, the author tells about Saeng failing her drivers test, and then seeing a familiar plant that she wants to buy. The middle of the story is about how she is having a hard time adapting to her new home. So to conclude the story, the author puts that Saeng will take her drivers test again, once the flowers starts budding, and the geese come out. The flower and the geese remind her of home, so this tells you that thinking of her home, and the objects that make her feel at home, comfort her, and help her overcome obstacles.	2	2		2																						126	5	142	9	0	0	4.3700787401574805	25.4	30	24	4	4	6	13	73	15.0	8.14	7.71	14	12.0	13.55	10.4	8.1	160

This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, “when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the season's bring things back, she will come back. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should perservere because things just take time."	2	1		2																						112	9	131	7	0	0	4.794642857142857	12.444444444444445	24	22	6	12	2	19	65	8.1	8.98	7.29	15	5.2	7.74	6.0	8.5	149
6907	10467	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” for several reasons, @CAPS1, Saeng decides that she is determined to pass her driving test just like the hibiscus. Saeng’s mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through,” and Saeng decides to be strong like the hibiscus and make it through and pass the test. Next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to @LOCATION1 because the geese “sound familiar.” As much as she misses her old home, she is adapting. Finally, one can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, that as much as she misses her old home, she’s starting to get used to her new country and she recognizes that she ispart of it. She knows that letting her past get in the way of her will not help her pass the test and, like the plant and the geese, she will return again.	3	3		3																						206	5	226	17	0	0	4.441747572815534	41.2	40	34	13	11	9	28	120	20.1	8.66	7.9	23	15.8	17.65	18.333333333333332	11.6	260
6908	10468	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver’s test.

6917	10477	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on.	3	3		3																						152	8	169	2	0	0	4.309210526315789	19.0	33	29	14	1	5	12	87	9.7	7.14	7.31	22	9.4	10.52	8.0	9.6	207

6923	10483	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus is a reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong and she compares herself to the geese saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter the hibiscus doesn’t bloom and Saeng fails her driver’s test. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the Hibiscus thrives and the geese return it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well.	2	2		2																						105	4	109	0	0	0	4.6	26.25	28	12	9	2	7	7	57	13.4	9.46	7.8	9	10.0	11.66	14.25	10.7	141
6924	10484	4	The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did.	1	2		2																						111	6	123	6	0	0	4.423423423423423	18.5	24	20	4	6	1	16	68	10.5	7.72	7.44	10	8.4	10.32	10.8	8.2	141

6942	10502	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the authore is trying to show the reader that she realized cares about the nature and loves It so because she is waiting for the spring and as soon as the spring comes she will take the test again.

6951	10511	4	The author is concluding that anything can happen in the story. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus and her mother was getting mad at her. Saeng’s mother was mad because she spent money on the whole plant instead of planting it and then it would be a lot cheaper. When her mother was mad and in disbelief, Saeng started crying and the mother forgave her for her actions. This shows that anything can happen	1	1		1																						73	5	78	1	0	0	4.52054794520548	14.6	16	11	5	2	4	7	41	7.2	7.94	7.17	10	6.6	7.48	6.9	7.6	101
6953	10513	4	The Author concludes the story with Saeng saying a vow silently to herself to show the reader that she will grow like the hibiscus plant and take the test again, this time determined to pass it. The plant gives Saeng hope because it reminds her of the homeland that she loved so much. When the hibiscus starts budding and gaining beautiful flowers, Saeng will “bud” too and gain her license.	1	1		1																						70	3	75	2	0	0	4.6	23.333333333333332	17	15	1	5	3	7	37	11.9	9.29	8.4	11	8.8	10.46	13.0	9.7	92
6960	10521	4	The story ands with that paragraph because Saeng believes next spring when her new hibiscus is born she will have good luck to pass her driving test. It is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the drivers test. Now she beleives that on her next driving test she will have the connection to her past experiences, ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort in a time of disappointment. Which Saeng thinks can help her pass the test.	2	1		2																						89	4	95	2	0	0	4.48314606741573	22.25	24	15	6	1	1	6	48	10.8	8.65	7.58	12	8.4	11.62	12.875	10.7	118
6964	10525	4	The author had the story end with the paragraph because all the ideas are brought together and to show that Saeng is ready for whats ahead. When they put in the flower they are concluding the flowers importance and how it relates to how the girl feels being happy or sad.

6992	10555	4	The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test.

7009	10572	4	The author concludes her story with the quote, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because the author  is showing that nature and the plant are valuable to her. Saeng (who says the quote) believes that the hibiscus will help her pass the test. Earlier on in the story it shows that when she gets in trouble, she rubs the plant leaves in her hands to help her overcome the problem. The author is making the idea clear and portraying the idea that the plant helps Saeng with obstacles.	1	2		2																						114	4	127	6	0	0	4.434782608695652	28.75	28	20	3	6	4	16	61	13.8	8.25	8.24	12	10.9	12.8	13.25	9.5	144

It shows the reader that dispite what @MONTH1 happen, how bad things seem, and how hopeless you feel, there’s always a way to make it better. Saeng failed her test, was in a new land, and had lost her grandmother, but still planned to try again. like the waves on the shore, they will always try to wash away the sand by coming back again. just like these waves, Saeng is willing to try again, as should we all.	1	1		1																						94	5	108	9	0	0	4.23404255319149	18.8	18	16	5	9	3	17	53	14.2	6.92	7.2	2	10.8	12.95	16.333333333333332	7.8	110

7038	10602	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. “It shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repition of season upon season…” It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that she’s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world.

7040	10604	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1.	3	3		3																						181	9	193	3	0	0	4.49171270718232	20.11111111111111	51	29	7	4	3	15	96	9.8	8.3	7.6	21	8.8	9.14	11.8	10.5	247
7046	10610	4	"The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the motivational paragraph  because he/she wants to show the reeder that  Saeng is determined to adapt to her new life and home and overcome common  obstacles like a driver's test. Saeng had a hard time coping with her problem so she bought a hibiscus because it reminded her of home. I think that the line “and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" from the last paragraph is a symbol for growing up and overcoming obstacles. The conclusion for the story is a nice ending."	2	2		2																						104	5	118	1	0	0	4.485981308411215	21.4	27	15	9	3	4	13	58	13.2	9.06	8.11	18	12.3	13.09	15.0	12.2	151
7055	10619	4	The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects.	1	2		2																						96	5	105	4	0	0	3.84375	19.2	14	15	5	6	4	10	66	6.3	4.47	5.9	6	6.1	8.93	10.2	7.6	111
7061	10625	4	I think that the author concludes the story like this because it shows a new beginning. When the spring comes, everything comes back to life. Plants grow back, animals are seen again and the sun shines bright. This is a new beginning for them so it can be seen the same for her. She could try again because it gives her another chance. Another reason he ended the story like this is because Saeng loves nature. Maybe when nature is back around her it will give her hope and confidence to pass her test.	1	1		1																						94	7	103	2	0	0	4.351063829787234	13.428571428571429	18	15	4	6	2	10	56	5.8	6.84	6.32	5	5.0	6.21	6.714285714285714	8.8	119
7064	10628	4	The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready.	1	2		2																						116	5	123	3	0	0	4.060344827586207	23.2	17	19	10	10	3	8	68	9.5	6.62	6.99	10	7.4	10.1	13.5	8.2	137
7066	10630	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it.	1	2		2																						121	5	132	2	0	0	4.229508196721311	24.4	22	24	4	7	4	15	78	7.3	6.38	6.71	13	6.5	7.58	7.833333333333334	7.4	160
7071	10635	4	She realized that things come and go but also change. That content times of the year the world around her changed. She had no control over it. She also had to deal with living in a new country. Living in anew country was hard for Saeng. She had to eat new foods, hear new sonds, and see thing that she never had seen before. Failing her drives test was hard for her. Not knowing the launge and what going on around her was tough of on her. the world around her wasnt something she was us to. She knew she had to change herself and work harder to get what she wanted.	2	2		2																						112	10	125	2	0	0	4.0625	11.2	16	24	7	5	5	12	71	3.9	4.8	6.79	8	3.4	5.32	4.666666666666667	5.0	132

7078	10642	4	There was a specific reason as to why the author concluded the story with that quote. The author wanted to show how the plant gave Saeng a new sense of determination.

So she now was determined to battle the odds as well and retake the test she failed.	1	2		2																						75	5	80	0	0	0	4.266666666666667	15.0	16	12	5	6	4	6	43	6.2	6.49	7.54	10	5.6	9.2	7.699999999999999	9.4	100

The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden – red color yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with.  The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window.

Also because his parents were selflessly getting out of cuba so there children could have a better place to live. Lastly there was a mood of family. They were honest hardworking immagrants who extended a hand to help people in need.

""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. ""In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells and lovely cuban music playing.

Rodriguez shares a unique happy feeling with this excerpt; the feeling of great memories that have been strengthened with each day.

The excerpt furthers these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own. The description of these selfless attitudes and ways helps paint a beautiful portrait of a family, with ""extended family"" also, forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen.

7480	12228	5	The mood the author creates is the sadness of living one country where freinds and family lived. To happiness of the times they've shared in the United States. As the memoir states the center of the home was the kitchen where here parents split cooking duties and where passionate Cuban music filled the air the the kitchen's aroma. In the kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their hope of creating a better life for the family even if it meant leaving their country, freinds, and family behind. The author also creates a mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister. These are the moods the author creates throughout the memoir.	2	3		3																						129	7	140	2	0	0	4.5813953488372094	18.428571428571427	41	16	3	5	5	9	71	9.4	8.82	7.12	10	6.9	7.98	11.2	8.4	172

Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion.

7487	12235	5	In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story.	2	3		3																						157	7	168	2	0	0	4.3630573248407645	22.428571428571427	31	21	8	6	9	11	104	10.3	7.9	7.56	17	8.5	10.49	11.0	9.6	203

The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture.

The cyclist could been affected by seeing the dessert and no scenary changes for a wahile. When you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything. So this cause him to be very drossy and bored. Also the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains were cold water. Having no water out in the dessert could make you dehydrate and faint.	1	2		2																						126	7	137	2	0	0	4.2936507936507935	18.0	31	19	9	3	5	13	76	7.8	6.84	7.54	13	6.8	8.15	11.0	8.4	163
3600	5995	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. Since he is riding in the California desert, he always feels very hot and is always in constant thirst. In addition to this the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate. He finds nothing but old abondored buildings. He doesn't find anyone. No people or cars, or any sign of modern civilization. This causes him to feel a little unnerved as if something happened to him nobody would know about it. This is especially prevelent when he become dehydrated. In those ways, the cyclist is very much affected by the setting.	2	2		2																						105	9	118	3	0	0	4.580952380952381	11.666666666666666	18	14	8	8	3	14	66	6.0	7.4	7.83	18	5.5	7.73	5.333333333333333	8.5	152
3601	5996	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way the setting affects the cyclist is, in the desert, the cyclist drank more water than before. For example, the text states “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you.	1	1		1																						91	5	102	6	0	0	4.4945054945054945	18.2	27	9	6	3	1	14	51	8.8	8.01	7.49	13	8.0	9.04	8.9	8.2	123
3603	5998	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, out of date information, and rolling hills. If he had up to date information then he would probably have got water from a town that’s not empty or almost empty like a “ghost town” as the cyclist said.	2	1		2																						52	2	56	2	0	0	4.3076923076923075	26.0	14	5	3	3	2	7	30	11.9	7.55	7.96	5	9.9	11.94	14.5	0.0	70
3606	6001	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the lock of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. He frind the water but e tar like substance come out and it tasted like battery. When he left he had to go through rough road which he couldn’t travel that fast leanes of the condition of the road.	1	1		1																						62	3	65	0	0	0	4.048387096774194	20.666666666666668	17	10	2	1	2	6	34	8.0	5.92	8.48	9	7.8	10.86	11.666666666666666	9.7	79
3607	6002	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time geting to Yosemite National Park. This is because the sun was out, and it was in the middle of June. I was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day. When the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills"", which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road."	2	2		2																						115	6	128	5	0	0	4.139130434782609	19.166666666666668	25	13	9	10	1	13	71	7.7	6.09	6.79	8	7.2	9.07	8.166666666666666	8.8	144
3612	6007	3	As the cyclist is travelling to Yosemite National Park, he comes across many features in the area that affects him. First, he takes directions from some old guys who don’t know anything about the changes in maps because they never leave their porch. At first, it affects him in a positive way, because he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, the affect later came negative because it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed. Another feature that affected him wasted the setting which was a desert-like area. The heat made it harder for him to ride his bike, and he also drank a lot of his water. This later resulted in him becoming dehydrated. A positive affect was when he found the bait shop, where he rehydrated himself and got some new directions.	2	3		3																						138	8	155	7	0	0	4.615942028985507	17.25	28	23	9	8	2	16	80	9.0	8.52	8.04	19	7.7	9.82	9.0	11.2	195
3614	6010	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One example is the hot sun that was beating down on him made him very thirsty. Another feature is the rough road that wore the cyclist out and made him tired. My last example is the old juice factory with the picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it made the cyclist feel like giving up because he thought he would die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways.	1	1		1																						96	5	101	0	0	0	4.3125	19.2	22	11	11	1	1	4	57	8.5	7.43	6.07	8	7.2	8.93	11.2	10.4	129
3616	6012	3	Understanding, realitic, mode-all are reason’s how setting affects the setting. If a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good. When you have a setting it’s more understable of what they are trying today. And if you have a good setting it makes it more realitic So when you read it you wont be thrown off, the mode of the story sets it all off, because usually books have there ups and downs. That’s why they chase the mode.	0	0		0																						83	6	95	4	0	0	4.325301204819277	13.833333333333334	17	11	6	6	2	14	49	7.3	6.78	7.12	6	6.2	8.09	7.9	7.6	105
3621	6017	3	The setting in the story changes many times. It starts in an area with rivers and pine trees. Then the cyclist arrives ant a town. After that he is pounded by the hot sun and along hilly road. With not much water left the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink. The setting was what made the cyclists journey a hard one.	1	1		1																						74	6	80	0	0	0	4.027027027027027	12.333333333333334	17	12	6	1	2	6	45	3.7	4.74	6.81	6	3.4	5.46	5.333333333333333	5.5	89
3622	6018	3	The features of the settings affect in the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit” it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart. Then..leaves and see these wide bunch of hills. inconclusion I would never do all the riding he did.	1	2		2																						83	4	88	0	0	0	4.289156626506024	20.75	16	13	4	5	5	8	53	19.5	8.14	9.12	11	15.9	17.08	21.75	0.0	106
3631	6027	3	Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.” His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn’t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel.	3	3		3																						240	8	258	6	0	0	4.308333333333334	30.0	58	37	22	9	10	30	124	16.0	7.85	8.83	33	13.0	15.48	14.25	11.2	305
3633	6029	3	The features of the selling effect the cyclist a lot. One factor that would effect the cyclist would be the heat. Also, because of this factor, he’s pobably suffering from lack of water. He’s probably really hot seeing he’s the only one cut in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles. Another feature of the setting that would probably effect the cyclist is the thought of there @MONTH1 be a car around this next turn. If he can’t see around the next turn he doesn’t know is coming. The cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up.	1	1		1																						104	7	113	2	0	0	4.4326923076923075	14.857142857142858	26	13	5	8	0	13	62	6.9	7.3	6.96	11	5.6	7.11	7.0	8.4	140
3640	6036	3	"I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” this shows that he is a warm and trobled by the change of the terrain. He also fells alone “I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path” he also. Though he was in a ghost town. “Summer time” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my detorating brain"" he felt that he was slowly dying. He also though he was losing it, the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was no seeing a mirage. But through it all he had hopes the author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things dont look good keep moving foward never look back and alway's be positive and take advanage of your surrounding.

3641	6037	3	Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared.

When the old men told him to take a difficult path and did his in tire setting changed for the worst. After this he was nearly over powered by devastating hills and dehydration was slowly creeping up on him as well. He had not nearly packed enuff water or supplies for a change such as that and he would regret it later. The Hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and mercilous mankind it even worse on him. This is how the change of setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						107	7	114	1	0	0	4.289719626168225	15.285714285714286	19	11	11	11	7	8	64	7.7	6.9	7.32	14	6.7	8.62	8.166666666666666	8.8	140

There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water.

3656	6052	3	How the setting of the place effects the cyclist is for one its to dry a cyclist would be ridy for haurst shouldn’t be in a place that’s dry.Like in the story it says “I was travelling through the high parts of California in June” meaning it was really hot and dry.Second would be the animals there dangerous.A cyclist should be riding in a place with diamond back snakes it says in the text “I toiled on.At some point,tumbleweeds crossed my path t a ridiculously larger skilt it really did look like adiamond back” which if it really has one would be really dangerous  & cyclist should not be riding in that type of dangerous places no matter what type there are.That is how the settings of the surrandings effect the cyclist & how can it’s a bad place for them to ride.	2	2		2																						143	6	157	1	0	0	4.221476510067114	24.833333333333332	35	14	11	9	3	20	83	70.0	9.37	13.65	13	55.9	58.39	62.0	0.0	195

3666	6062	3	The bike rider in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1, is greatly affected by the condition of land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running, low on water. However since it is such a dry place he can’t find any. Also since it is out in the middle of no where, there is no one he can ask for some.

3671	6067	3	The features that affected the cyclist was plenty of things. One thing would be lack of water. In the text he said the pump gave water that taste like battery acid. Another one would be all the surroundings changed from what the old men sald and he got lost. When he was lost he had to have determination to find someone say that he could survive.	1	1		1																						66	5	71	0	0	0	4.2727272727272725	13.2	16	12	2	0	1	6	38	5.3	6.19	7.4	7	4.9	7.1	6.4	8.2	84
3675	6071	3	In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclist’s surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in “the high deserts of California in June,” the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings.	2	2		2																						101	7	117	8	0	0	4.762376237623762	14.428571428571429	24	9	10	8	4	20	55	8.2	8.69	9.2	22	6.5	7.74	7.0	8.8	145
3678	6074	3	The features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist. He’s in California in June, and it’s very hot. It’s pretty much a desert. When he stops for water, the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops. Also, the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid. So this is not very good for the cyclist.	2	2		2																						69	6	78	3	0	0	3.971014492753623	11.5	17	4	6	7	1	10	44	3.0	3.81	6.27	4	3.1	5.18	4.916666666666667	5.5	82
3679	6075	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the “resevoir compground” he’s feeling pretty good because he’s just leaving “the serenity of an early-summer evening and he’s headed toward “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” He’s in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he’s anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the “ghost town” and the “sun was beginning to beat down” he’s less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, he’s still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once “a thriving little spot.” Next, when the cyclist comes to “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral” he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a “tarlike substance” so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the “rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake” it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom” and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better.	3	3		3																						239	8	264	14	0	0	4.7489539748953975	29.875	48	34	23	26	15	41	128	15.9	10.17	8.49	34	12.6	13.47	20.333333333333332	12.2	330
3681	6077	3	The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn’t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						96	5	107	6	0	0	4.572916666666667	19.2	19	11	6	9	2	12	59	16.2	9.3	7.7	10	13.3	13.94	18.0	11.2	131
3685	6081	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist.

3686	6082	3	Sun, amount of miles, people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot. Also, he said that he really didn’t seem to notice it through in his mind it affected the cyclist. Next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept,	1	1		1																						71	4	80	6	0	0	4.47887323943662	17.75	17	12	1	5	1	9	44	8.5	7.65	7.19	8	7.9	8.81	10.125	9.5	98
3689	6085	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonist’s problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June, “ and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because ” The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it.	3	3		3																						215	7	233	9	0	0	4.534883720930233	30.714285714285715	45	33	18	20	7	26	116	21.4	9.36	9.15	37	17.7	19.06	18.333333333333332	13.0	299
3691	6087	3	The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn’t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.	2	2		2																						78	6	84	0	0	0	4.294871794871795	13.0	19	14	4	5	0	7	47	5.3	6.25	6.31	6	4.8	6.23	6.0	7.2	103

Either that, of the towns said to be, “a ghost town.” @CAPS1 this couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is “traveling through the deserts of California in June.” Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels.	3	2		3																						132	8	141	2	0	0	4.492424242424242	16.5	32	14	6	13	4	14	79	10.7	8.18	7.96	14	9.5	11.53	11.0	10.9	183
3704	6100	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the essay, it states, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.” This statement might affect the cyclist in the way that, they fear if they get into any trouble there is no one around to help out. This statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way. In the essay, it states, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral they couldn’t had in the larger mule greeted me.” This statement simply gives the cyclist the impression that this particular town is juice, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, @MONTH1 be decades. The different features of the journey of the cyclist in the essay, many would fear the outcome,if they over fear the journey and turned “old timers” who had never left their porches, in order to experience such things.	1	2		2																						175	7	198	13	0	0	4.537142857142857	25.0	46	24	12	6	4	24	102	17.5	8.89	7.99	17	13.4	14.91	13.0	9.4	228

3711	6107	3	In the story “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The most challenging problem faced  by the author was the lack of water. “ I pumped that handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t calm down nor I tried a drip or two,it had the flaver of beatterly acid.When @CAPS2 set out for the next train @CAPS2 came to a road that read “Rough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.

The effected the determination the cyclist had left @CAPS2 the regreted not listening to the old men of didn’t think they knew what they were talking about.

3714	6110	3	'Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit’ by Joe Kurmaskie demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. First off, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle. This affected her because if they had been in a car, or on a bus alot less energy would have been used up. Secondly, the cyclist started running out of water. This setting didn’t help because they were on a bike so that kept them hydrated. Another setting that affected the plot was the deserted towns. If they hadn’t been deserted everything would have been better. These features affected the cyclist a great deal.	1	2		2																						108	8	120	3	0	0	4.638888888888889	13.5	25	15	6	3	1	15	63	7.2	8.4	7.52	13	6.2	7.99	8.0	10.7	156

For example, after @NUM1 miles he looked upon the “ramshackeled sched, several rusty bumps and the corral… This sight troubled me. In the desert his water tasted like the flavor of “battery acid.” It also goes on to say that it was a “test for my inner spirit.” It also states that he went along with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds. This passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did and made it with a little confidence. Although his situation was somewhat unbearable he still kept striving on.	2	2		2																						112	6	120	2	0	0	4.584070796460177	18.833333333333332	21	18	11	4	2	15	68	11.5	9.29	9.12	23	9.7	12.17	14.25	11.2	157
3728	6124	3	“Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from California June, but not none the less. Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12. And worse a billboard of “a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding contributed to his hoplessness.	2	3		3																						140	8	156	10	0	0	4.564285714285714	17.5	41	17	11	9	6	21	71	8.8	8.12	8.68	29	7.8	10.43	7.0	10.1	196
3735	6131	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the author in many ways. One feature was the hills. The speed limit affected the author because he felt that he was moving to slow.

3737	6133	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn’t have much water to drink.	1	1		1																						53	3	59	3	0	0	4.150943396226415	17.666666666666668	11	7	4	3	2	7	35	7.0	5.86	8.09	5	5.5	7.83	8.166666666666666	6.4	64
3745	6141	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The @LOCATION1 desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist. For example the was further route, he takes is not only @LOCATION1, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he @MONTH1 restock on water and become hydrated once again.	2	2		2																						91	7	100	3	0	0	4.604395604395604	13.0	23	16	5	7	4	12	51	7.8	8.05	8.03	17	6.9	8.72	7.75	9.3	131
3746	6142	3	Many different things affected on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a “ghost town” there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, directions he was given, and lack of water. When the cyclist come across the bait shop he know he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and water.	2	2		2																						149	6	164	8	0	0	4.530201342281879	24.833333333333332	39	18	14	2	5	14	80	12.3	8.71	7.62	14	9.4	11.8	14.5	10.5	198
3747	6143	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says “ The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was don’t ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh”. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back..

3749	6145	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he’ll have later on. As he passes a snake, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” So the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, “…I could drop from heatstroke…” meaning he’s starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. Which effects him because he’s beginning to loose hope and  thinks he’s not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story.	2	3		3																						173	9	190	6	0	0	4.27683615819209	19.666666666666668	40	31	10	8	6	23	86	11.5	7.78	8.15	22	9.4	11.5	13.75	9.6	225
3756	6152	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...” This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip."	2	2		2																						124	7	145	7	0	0	4.672	17.857142857142858	26	17	11	9	5	17	69	11.1	8.94	8.74	22	9.0	12.15	12.2	11.9	172
3764	6160	3	The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.” This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration.	2	1		2																						113	7	128	7	0	0	4.876106194690266	16.142857142857142	33	17	8	3	4	14	57	12.9	10.45	7.97	17	9.7	11.87	11.2	11.2	160

3768	6164	3	The cyclist lost hope because he was in the California desserts in June. The cyclist started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump that pumped out battery-acid tasting water. When he said the sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, was very cautious. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.

3785	6181	3	The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to “short, rolling hills”. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.” He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless.	2	3		3																						129	6	135	1	0	0	4.465116279069767	21.5	22	26	6	8	4	9	77	10.4	8.24	7.64	15	9.3	10.46	11.2	9.3	176

3798	6194	3	The setting affects the biker in many ways. For one, he is riding through the high deserts of California during the month of June. It is naturally hot in the summer, but in the desert, it is twice as hot. This means he will dehydrate quicker, and will need more water. The only water the biker can find is from an old pump, but he couldn’t drink it since it was so hot; nasty tasting. “When I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acid” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was deserted, so nobody could help him. Also, the terrain was bad. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,” (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous. The biker is being affected in many ways, both mentally and physically.	3	3		3																						200	14	229	11	0	0	4.5	14.285714285714286	38	30	18	15	5	31	109	8.1	7.6	7.39	28	7.4	9.48	8.166666666666666	10.3	276
3799	6195	3	The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was faced with a desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die…”. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst.

The cyclist started at a camp ground and conversing with some old dogers, and he asks them how to get to Yosemite, and the tell him a shortcut that turns out to be out of date. On the road to Yosemite he sees nothing except abandoned towns. He is really thirsty and there’s no water anywhere. He thought he was going to die. He said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It was a hot summer day and there was tumbleweeds and snakes by the road and him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it was cooler and if there was a big river flowing by the road.

3823	6219	3	The setting of this essay was the California desert in June. If any of the settings features affected the cyclist(which they all did) This had the biggest impact. In the fifth paragraph, the reader leaves that the author was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” My prior knowledge tells me that California is generally always a very hot place especially in the desert in June, the hottest month of the year This would have greatly affected the cyclist. He was riding for over fifty miles through the California desert  with a limited supply of water. This put him at a great risk for dehydration, which he tells the reader he reaches in the last time of paragraph ten. This terrain and the extremely hot conditions would make the cyclist very tired and dehydrated, making his journey to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 all the more difficult.	2	2		2																						146	7	158	4	0	0	4.836734693877551	21.0	38	14	12	9	2	17	82	13.6	10.62	8.3	26	11.6	13.01	15.25	12.7	216
3824	6220	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn’t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						161	13	188	8	0	0	4.177914110429448	12.538461538461538	37	27	7	8	5	26	95	5.2	5.68	6.95	12	5.0	6.6	8.0	8.1	207
3829	6225	3	"The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worst he personally felt. For example, when he hit the ghost town, he just laughed. Once he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of once exisiting civilization, and he says, ”This sight is troubling,”. Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him. The climate in the story also becomes @CAPS1 difficult.

The setting takes place in the deserts of California, in early summer. There are no other people in there, no establishments, towns, etc. ; @CAPS1 dangerous feature of the setting in addition to it being in a desert in summer, for example the author is the town learntedat “might have been a thriving little spot at one time-sat, before the last world war’. The cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water. For example he says “I was going to lie…slowly gaining elevation while losing hope”. The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives. He lerns, because the setting the setting is now lifeles and deserted, to not listen to old people who remember the current setting on if as it was many decades earlier. Because the features of the setting nearly kill the cyclist, the cyclist learns a lesson.	3	2		3																						187	9	208	10	0	0	4.553191489361702	20.88888888888889	53	23	11	13	2	27	99	10.6	8.65	7.89	28	10.2	10.86	11.6	10.5	272

3848	6244	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example the tumbleweeds and the snakes. Being that its not out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																						96	7	103	0	0	0	4.479166666666667	13.714285714285714	24	8	4	5	3	7	60	6.5	7.71	6.78	9	6.3	7.15	6.714285714285714	8.4	132
3863	6259	3	When cycling or doing any outdoor sport, the setting matters greatly. If its cold you need a jacket. Hot you need water. Depending on how secure it could be life or death. It could be realy hilly and you might get tired, and if you have no water you could die. Also it depends if its in a city burbed, small town, desert, highway all these factors play a huge roll in cycling	3	2		3																						73	6	83	5	0	0	4.1506849315068495	12.166666666666666	16	12	5	4	4	10	40	4.2	5.09	6.62	10	3.3	5.43	5.25	5.5	91
3866	6262	3	"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,”  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist.

The cyclist listened to the old men so therefour he traveled a good distance. So that made matters bad. With having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst. The cyclist thought of him dying and the birds picking him clean, because he thought he would die because dehydration. The conditions of the road made it harder, First he started with nothing but straight roads then ended up going up and down hill. In conclusion, the cyclist hit many obstacles that made his trip harder then what he thought.	2	2		2																						132	9	144	3	0	0	4.621212121212121	14.666666666666666	31	22	13	7	2	14	73	7.7	8.34	7.48	21	6.7	7.7	5.875	8.2	181
3880	6276	3	As if along bike ride through the city isn’t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. “High deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good.	3	2		3																						158	9	176	9	0	0	4.6835443037974684	17.555555555555557	39	17	12	11	4	26	89	10.5	9.05	8.42	28	8.7	11.21	12.0	10.4	229
3890	6286	3	There were many features of the setting that affect he cyclist to make his difficut journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise. For example, “I followed their advice and launched out at first line, nd along a ‘short cut” that was toslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed @CAPS1, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate. For example, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death. For example “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This is stating without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die.	2	3		3																						189	10	206	9	0	0	4.431578947368421	19.0	49	24	18	6	3	26	103	13.1	8.25	8.23	28	10.3	12.7	13.75	10.6	247
3894	6290	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when he arrived to the first town the water had tasted like battery acid which made the rider concerve water another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature. The ride would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster.	1	1		1																						65	3	68	0	0	0	4.3076923076923075	21.666666666666668	17	9	5	1	0	4	37	9.7	7.43	7.87	9	9.4	10.53	12.166666666666666	9.7	89
3897	6293	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie’s, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""This sentence from the text stores he is dehydrated, because of this it creates an obstacle he must face. Also, another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is, the rough road ahead he had to face. “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign I would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead. Luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well."	2	1		2																						129	8	144	7	0	0	4.457364341085271	16.125	35	19	4	8	2	19	68	15.7	8.43	8.05	17	13.5	14.47	18.666666666666668	11.2	177
3898	6294	3	There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One feature is the climate. When you are cycling and it is really hot you can dehydrate very fast. If it is really cold it is harder to breath and catch your breath. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep than you will get very tired quickly and when it is rocky you have a posablity to fall off the bike and hurt yourself. Last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist. Also if the road is so isolated and you get hurt who would find you. This is another deadly situation. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						166	11	178	1	0	0	4.150602409638554	15.090909090909092	27	19	14	11	6	12	112	5.7	5.79	6.19	14	5.6	7.0	7.0	8.6	217
3905	6301	3	In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town the setting isn’t described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isn’t in working condition. Until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living , when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in.	3	3		3																						215	14	232	5	0	0	4.441860465116279	15.357142857142858	62	26	15	9	9	19	121	7.8	7.77	7.11	22	6.2	7.35	7.833333333333334	7.0	288
3909	6305	3	The setting it the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” in three ways. One way is that it is very baren so there is no shade to stop the sun that is beating down the the cyclist body which adds to his dehydration and lack of to focus. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the terrain the rolling hills, and desert he bikes through the hills make him work harder using up more energy and exsusaing his ater supply the desert also with it enemies heat make his not trust himself thinks there mirages he sees. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns when he sees them he get a hope of relief that he might get water and out the heat but when he passes in he finds nothing and leaves him chrested and think of death.	3	2		3																						147	4	153	1	0	0	4.115646258503402	36.75	34	27	4	4	7	11	87	16.4	6.92	9.01	19	12.9	15.81	18.333333333333332	9.5	182
3913	6309	3	In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water. He also had to manuver around a snake. It made him tired and dehydratied.

He got dehydratied from the sun.	1	1		1																						45	5	50	0	0	0	4.355555555555555	9.0	9	6	3	2	1	7	27	3.6	5.54	6.19	6	3.3	4.49	3.9000000000000004	6.7	60
3918	6314	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist because if you are going down hil and then hit a rough road you not going to do so good.

3919	6315	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.	1	2		2																						73	4	78	0	0	0	4.232876712328767	18.25	18	10	7	2	3	5	41	7.6	6.85	7.57	9	6.9	8.42	8.875	8.1	96
3921	6317	3	There are many ways in which the setting of “Rough Road ahead” affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a problem because it is very dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” It is obvious here that lack of water is affecting his in a big way. He almost collapsed because he is so thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Since there was rolling now, the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop. Lastly, the “rough road” affected the cyclist. The road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so I could renew my energy. The heat, remotness of the area, and the rough road all affected the cyclist on his journey.	2	1		2																						205	13	227	10	0	0	4.151219512195122	15.76923076923077	42	30	14	13	5	28	128	6.7	5.86	6.8	23	6.4	8.6	6.857142857142857	8.8	262
3931	6327	3	In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit”(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end.	2	2		2																						176	7	190	5	0	0	3.8983050847457625	25.285714285714285	36	29	7	11	4	20	107	11.7	5.47	7.24	13	10.0	12.63	17.666666666666668	7.8	211
3940	6336	3	"The dry desert like setting would affect the cyclist because he could easily become dehydrated from the sun, and loss of water through sweat. The cyclist states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Rough Road Ahead). The man is badly dehydrated, but in his determination he moves on. The terrain went from being flat, to short rolling hills. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water. The man goes can to say, “ I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me ""(Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviosly desert like, so it is dry, hot, and dusty. This would definately have an affect on his body which is sweating, which causes dehydration due to water loss. In conclusion the cyclist was greately affected by the setting."	3	2		3																						166	10	193	13	0	0	4.632530120481928	16.6	44	23	10	8	5	30	84	9.6	8.59	7.31	21	8.1	9.77	8.333333333333334	10.3	227
3946	6342	3	First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a “shortcut” that will take him right to his destination. Then the cyclist was faced with rough rolling hills of a highway. Over his long journey the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination.	1	1		1																						54	4	59	1	0	0	4.666666666666667	13.5	11	8	5	4	0	5	31	7.3	8.63	7.52	7	5.0	6.88	6.5	8.1	71
3947	6343	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in @LOCATION1 in he middle of June he wouldn’t of gotten so dehydrated. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to @NUM1° degrees. In the middle of @DATE2 in @CAPS1.A it bearly reaches @NUM2° degrees. Also the desert is know to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in “No @CAPS2’s @CAPS3”. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels.	1	1		1																						142	8	155	3	0	0	4.584507042253521	17.75	42	17	7	14	2	20	80	8.0	8.18	8.09	20	7.1	7.45	5.75	8.5	196
3954	6350	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, One way was the weather. In the story it said “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kermaskie @NUM1). Thats quote said he is in a desert and desert are usally warm. It also said in June and June is usally a hot temp month. The weath affected the cyclist because it was hot and he started to become dehydrated and had little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the souroundings. In the story it said. “There was no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind “(kurmaskie). That saying there know one around to help him so if he gets hurt or something. Also theres no where to get some water.	2	1		2																						131	11	148	2	0	0	4.343511450381679	11.909090909090908	34	17	6	6	6	16	74	6.3	6.55	6.89	12	5.4	7.98	7.571428571428571	9.4	176
3955	6351	3	Many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the “high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 about that passage says blistering heat; high meaning its going to be closer to sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closet water supply was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” there was a “long crippling hill” all while the sun was heating down.  All of that would most obviously effect the cyclists by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing conscionous.	2	3		3																						119	4	133	9	0	0	4.775	30.0	28	14	11	5	2	21	64	21.1	10.4	9.06	23	16.4	17.56	14.0	12.5	169
3965	6361	3	Durring the cyclist @CAPS1 he was affected by the setting frequently. When he was cycling it be came very hott to him but at first it wasn’t so bad. “The sun was begining to beat dow, but I barely Noticed it.” This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not affect him. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was travling in. “I had been hitting my water bottles pritty regularly and I was travling through the high dezerts in califonia in June.” This proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out. All of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his @CAPS2.	2	2		2																						123	8	130	1	0	0	4.308943089430894	15.375	22	20	4	8	5	17	71	14.2	7.79	8.5	18	11.8	14.27	19.333333333333332	11.7	165
3970	6366	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states “with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind”, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel.

The setting plays a big part in his ""challenge"", from the pine trees to the barren hills. In the begining of his trie he passes a ""gbost town"" that has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that, ""had my name written all over them."" This gives him hope and reassurance. Then the rusty pump and ""ramshackle shed."" They took the hope and reasurance away, making him cautrous. The hills that made him work hard to get over, the snake that slowed him down and the whelches juice company that was abundanded all didn't help and made matters worse. Then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better. It the setting has less the same the whole way he wouldn't have had any hope or he would have hope but it wouldn't fall and rise, making the story interenting."	3	3		3																						188	11	218	8	0	0	4.398936170212766	17.09090909090909	44	28	16	8	12	27	113	7.8	7.02	7.51	21	6.4	9.18	7.2857142857142865	9.1	240

But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned.

Dehydration caused by heat could not enough water caused the cyclist to sweat and to feel nautious. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh. In this quote he is thinking about all the bad and horrible things that could happen to him because he is already in an bad state.

4010	6406	3	Some of the things that affect the cyclist was the lack of water. “The water, bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, water is a big importance. To stort men. Your body need water to work right. The @CAPS1 humid, dry weather of California was a affect To. “The high deserts of California in June.” “l could drop from a heatstroke.” The sun is unbearable, expessary without shade and water, @CAPS2 affect on the cyclist up.

4021	6417	3	In the essay intitled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit” the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, “At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.” This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of “old-timers.” From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, “About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first “town”, a ghost town,” “The sun was beginning to heat down,” This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a “A Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood.	3	3		3																						272	8	293	13	0	0	4.268382352941177	34.0	83	31	14	14	7	37	144	25.9	7.79	8.89	26	21.0	23.23	29.0	14.3	360
4025	6421	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like hes coming or going on a vacation and because of the way hes riding it it seems hes going real fast as about to fall.	1	1		1																						57	1	61	0	0	0	3.9473684210526314	57.0	9	10	0	3	4	1	35	25.7	6.4	8.96	5	22.0	24.2	30.5	0.0	75
4043	6439	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by that he or she should behave act or talk according to the settings. It means that where ever they are existing and whatever it looks like, they need to fit them self in. They also need to fit the mood according to where they are located. The cyclist is feeling comfortable according to the story and he dosent need any change in setting or location. For conclusion the features of the setting affects the cyclist by that he needs to make improvment and changes according to where he or she is located.	1	1		1																						101	5	107	1	0	0	4.465346534653466	20.2	18	22	1	2	7	6	60	9.7	8.3	7.61	14	8.8	11.25	12.2	12.0	141
4044	6440	3	In the beginning the cyclist was ready to go and happy. By the time he got half way there he was “losing hope”. It was very hot and he was simple alone. By the end, he was relieved because not only did he find water, he found an easier way to get to Yosemite. The first old group of men didn’t help, but the second man did.	1	1		1																						67	5	74	3	0	0	3.8358208955223883	13.4	13	9	9	4	3	10	40	3.4	3.7	5.95	4	3.8	5.96	6.1	6.7	81
4049	6445	3	In the passage “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” the setting must definetly affects the cyclist. When the cyclist comes for the first abandured “town” he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” The makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water it is just undrinkable. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist in on his last legs he must work even harder to get water a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” this quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist most perservere. Also quote “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridicuosly large snake –“tumble weeds and snakes give the feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is what the cyclist is this point. The setting of this story directly correalates with how the cyclist is feeling.	3	3		3																						165	6	172	3	0	0	4.6909090909090905	27.5	42	20	11	14	5	18	88	17.2	10.22	8.91	24	13.8	15.62	18.0	11.6	225
4057	6453	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it say that the temperture was was getting high and that when he drank the water that it test like battery acid. This would affect him because it it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot how would he be able to get through the day with out pasing out also in paragraph @NUM2 it say the roads changed to hill when you ride up and down the hills you become tired from pumping you legs then you would feel hot and tiredd and would not want to ride the bike. That how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						117	4	120	0	0	0	4.102564102564102	29.25	21	19	6	5	5	8	74	17.4	6.86	8.0	9	13.8	15.94	25.5	6.4	141
4059	6455	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town. ""This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on."	2	3		3																						193	10	217	11	0	0	4.896373056994818	19.3	45	27	12	11	6	24	106	12.4	10.33	8.87	40	10.5	12.5	15.5	12.7	291
4062	6458	3	The features in the setting of this story affect the cyclist very much so. Throughout this story this poor person has to get lost and end up in the middle of nowhere. By her being out her cycle was being affected. She was just trying to get somewhere and get things done, but of course she didn’t. She kept moving on down. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it bad.	1	1		1																						76	6	83	1	0	0	4.171052631578948	12.666666666666666	11	15	3	9	5	7	51	4.5	5.5	6.97	8	4.7	5.61	5.5	5.5	96
4068	6464	3	When the cyclist went to ask about the road the old men told him all its good way that he should go. But the old man hasn’t seen the land in a really long time. The man don’t long that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends ?? the cyclist didn’t know what to do.	1	1		1																						65	5	70	0	0	2	3.830769230769231	13.0	12	12	5	4	2	8	35	4.9	4.46	6.4	1	4.8	6.4	7.625	7.2	74
4075	6471	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it’s very hot outside and he is starting to loose energy. The setting affects how fast he rides when he stops or when he drinks or eats. all of these depend on the type of weather he is riding in. like in the story it was so hot out when he saw a building he wiped the sweat from his face to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.	1	1		1																						74	4	78	0	0	0	3.891891891891892	18.5	12	13	4	4	3	6	43	15.4	5.58	8.46	5	13.0	15.34	19.0	0.0	91
4082	6478	3	The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn’t find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another.	3	3		3																						198	11	212	4	0	0	4.409090909090909	18.0	40	36	10	12	9	20	116	9.2	7.72	8.05	32	8.7	10.75	12.0	11.0	280

4092	6488	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didn’t have much water. In the text it says “I was traveling the high desserts of California in June.” The deserts are always hot and June is a very hot month. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasn’t able to drink much because he had limited water.	1	1		1																						75	3	78	0	0	0	4.28	25.0	20	8	9	4	3	6	40	11.2	7.55	7.82	7	9.5	11.6	13.833333333333334	9.7	98
4094	6490	3	In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the setting greatly affects the cyclist. With long rides, hilly roads, and very little water the cyclist was pretty good. I mean he could have been very angry but he kept his cool and stayed calm.	1	1		1																						45	3	50	2	0	0	4.4	15.0	9	6	6	5	3	5	21	6.8	7.01	7.89	6	5.6	6.0	6.5	3.1	58
4095	6491	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welch’s Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,” describes the cyclist, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the “shortcut.” “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,” reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, “ By the looks of it- had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.	3	3		3																						194	8	214	15	0	0	4.577319587628866	24.25	53	21	16	11	4	29	106	19.5	9.01	8.57	25	16.1	16.76	28.5	11.2	262
4102	6498	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being hott affected him because it mad him more thirsty.

4105	6501	3	The setting of the place was “ghost town” as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldn’t ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of new world because they told him the wrong directions.	1	1		1																						64	4	68	0	0	0	4.0	16.0	16	7	6	2	0	7	36	5.4	5.28	5.91	3	4.8	7.65	7.5	7.2	78

4123	6519	3	First the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem. That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn’t trust the guy. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desteart road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn’t attack him. Finally the biker faced his  las long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water.	2	2		2																						181	11	195	1	0	0	3.9395604395604398	16.545454545454547	34	38	13	16	9	14	103	5.4	4.93	7.07	12	5.0	7.26	10.8	7.3	218
4127	6523	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat in “the high deserts of California in June. The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds rattle snakes and ghost towns. All of these make the cyclist start to give up hope. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally.	2	2		2																						95	7	105	3	0	0	4.863157894736842	13.571428571428571	28	12	3	6	4	10	49	8.2	9.74	7.3	12	7.4	8.81	7.357142857142858	10.3	143
4135	6531	3	I read “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by accepting advice from “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches @CAPS1 was in office”	1	1		1																						41	1	41	0	0	0	4.682926829268292	41.0	15	8	1	0	0	7	17	21.1	10.64	11.83	12	16.9	18.35	22.5	0.0	59
4136	6532	3	In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states “The sun was beginning to beat down,” @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says “@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states “dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting.	2	3		3																						160	9	180	10	0	0	4.475	17.77777777777778	51	25	9	7	3	27	84	9.6	7.72	7.89	20	7.6	9.0	8.0	8.5	210
4145	6541	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says “…and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…” @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote “…ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool.	2	2		2																						138	5	152	6	0	0	4.028368794326241	28.2	31	17	16	3	4	17	78	11.8	6.33	7.64	15	9.3	12.2	10.6	8.2	171
4151	6547	3	He’s on a very hot climate, in a desert, so he needs lots of water, but he has a limited supply. He’s riding on hills, which makes it even harder. He can’t find any towns that aren’t abandoned.	2	2		2																						38	3	45	4	0	0	4.105263157894737	12.666666666666666	10	6	2	5	1	10	19	4.3	4.57	9.67	5	3.5	6.13	5.666666666666667	6.4	46
4157	6553	3	"Many things about the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. The terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts. This contributes to the cyclist nagging sensation for a drink of water. The ride on the hills and through the desert, also tire him out dramatically. Not to mention while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finds the water it is “tarlike” and ""in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. The cyclist in this story really must want to get Yosemite National park if he is willing to go all through all this trouble. The old men he asked in Lodi, California hadn’t left the town in decades and gave the cyclist faulty directions that could of killed him. So he asked for directions and was given inadequet information, which made life very difficult for the cyclist."	2	2		2																						147	7	160	4	0	0	4.673469387755102	21.0	36	20	9	9	6	18	82	9.8	9.28	8.09	22	8.1	10.35	8.666666666666666	10.7	207
4158	6554	3	The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affect the cyclist so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a desert, in mid- June, with the heat “beginning to beat down” on him. This feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water, but when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself. The cyclist began to realize that he “could trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS1, the long distance and changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling, affected him. The distance on which to cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park, consisted of hours and miles of riding. Over vast changes of terrain. The “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills”, which affected the cyclist speed and energy to finish his trip.	3	2		3																						148	7	166	11	0	0	4.648648648648648	21.142857142857142	41	22	14	3	4	25	72	11.0	8.82	7.99	22	9.2	10.06	13.0	9.6	202
4167	6563	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the “high desserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact.	3	3		3																						184	13	201	7	0	0	4.385869565217392	14.153846153846153	48	28	14	1	4	25	101	10.7	7.72	7.27	19	8.7	10.72	11.2	9.8	248
4172	6568	3	The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn’t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff	1	1		1																						52	3	56	1	0	0	4.173076923076923	17.333333333333332	11	11	3	4	1	4	29	6.9	6.32	6.92	5	6.5	7.69	8.0	6.4	65
4173	6569	3	In the cyclist’s outlook on his journey through Yosemite’s park, reader’s can get a good feel of how it might be to be riding right along side. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride. He sees such a vast variety of scenery including rivers, sandy dry deserts also, as well as cool pines and trees in the park part. He said it was also breezy which probably made for an enjoyable temperature.	1	1		1																						76	4	83	3	0	0	4.368421052631579	19.0	19	7	8	7	1	10	45	8.7	7.54	8.53	7	7.2	10.23	11.0	10.1	96
4176	6572	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off. It caused him to go dehiderated because lack of water and he went kind of dilerious. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was un drinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree. Lastly, the Welch’s factory that he came across was teasing him in in the way that he couldn’t have the liquids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch’s juice. Not only did the cyclist get off track because the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable.	3	2		3																						143	7	155	5	0	0	4.496503496503497	20.428571428571427	31	22	10	8	4	17	85	10.0	8.3	8.29	21	7.7	10.12	8.166666666666666	9.6	193
4182	6579	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self- determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths inorder to reach their destination.For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are based to reach some rough spots where it seems you can’t walk. But that is where self–determination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there @MONTH1 be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip, when you don’t have the right provision to keep you self energised you can ‘t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything.This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						145	6	160	4	0	0	4.523809523809524	24.5	36	23	6	3	4	18	89	18.3	9.35	8.05	15	15.1	16.73	14.75	13.8	203
4187	6584	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into “short, rolling hills,” These hills are increasing the difficulty and are causing him doubt that he will make it. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The horizon was what kept cyclist going. “I began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.’ The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it.	3	2		3																						154	8	168	8	0	0	4.48051948051948	19.25	37	21	9	4	4	21	91	18.9	8.6	8.62	22	15.9	17.74	18.333333333333332	12.2	208
4189	6586	3	When the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence. He biked to the first town but it was like a “ghost town.” A town is a town. soon after that, he did not see anything. No cars, buildings, or anything. He was getting sad and dehydrated. The old men swore there was a town coming up so he put his trust and confidence in him once again. He saw a building  coming up, but it was just an old wore down factory. He thought he was let down. He was sure he was going to die, right there right now. He than saw a siga for a fish comp! He was overjoyed! The place was real to! He thought of them as his savior! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously.	1	2		2																						132	15	152	5	4	0	3.962406015037594	8.866666666666667	22	20	8	11	5	22	81	2.4	3.45	6.06	11	2.5	4.99	5.75	6.7	161
4194	6591	3	When your with your family in ocean city biking down the board walk your only obstacle is people. When your in a race on whinedy roads you could have lots of obstacles. The wheather could be your greatest obstacle. You could pass out by lack of water and scorcing heat. You could fall over by slippery roads from the rain. Along with that nature could lay its toll apon you. “a ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of @NUM1, Kurmaskie) @CAPS1 like a snake you don’t know what you could come across.	1	1		1																						97	8	107	1	0	0	4.459183673469388	12.25	29	10	4	4	1	16	53	7.9	7.89	7.86	10	4.9	8.54	8.25	9.3	121
4199	6596	3	In the story the features of setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn`t going to make it. When he finally got to “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp,” he learned a lesson because when an old man asked if he know the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map.''	2	2		2																						132	6	142	4	0	0	4.212121212121212	22.0	21	27	6	7	4	12	81	9.5	6.73	7.61	12	8.3	10.25	8.5	9.3	170
4202	6599	3	First, by accepting the old mens’ advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would, easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a “ghost town”, lifeless and most importantly, waterless. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like “battery acid”. Next he rides past a “Rough Road Ahead” sign; not the most encouraging thing on his journey. To add to the despair, he has to manever his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp. “To him, this simple bait shop was like  beacon of hope from food himself.	2	3		3																						110	6	127	9	0	0	4.702702702702703	18.5	29	15	8	9	3	27	53	10.1	9.28	8.71	19	8.1	9.87	9.0	10.5	154
4207	6604	3	The setting in the begining of the story is flat an easy but as the path becomes unfamiliar it turns into many hills & turns. This effects the cyclist a lot because he was low on water & was begining to become dehydrated.	2	2		2																						43	2	45	0	0	0	4.162790697674419	21.5	10	5	5	0	3	2	24	9.4	7.49	7.73	6	10.1	11.13	12.75	0.0	62
4216	6613	3	The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water. There are obsticles in the road too, such as, the big snake laying across the middle of the road. He is lost without water and could possibly die of an heatstroke.	1	1		1																						53	4	60	3	0	0	4.283018867924528	13.25	11	8	2	3	3	8	33	5.4	5.9	6.98	6	4.9	7.58	6.375	8.1	69
4224	6621	3	"The setting that were affecting the cyclist was the lack of water he had because it says “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" and the text also says "" I’ld read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate” he wouldn’t be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasn’t thirsty."	1	1		1																						66	1	69	1	0	0	4.333333333333333	66.0	15	15	2	5	1	7	35	31.8	8.78	11.72	9	26.3	28.46	37.0	0.0	88
4225	6622	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldn’t find any building or water for many miles. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didn’t know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																						56	4	61	1	0	0	5.017857142857143	14.0	18	8	2	0	4	8	29	9.2	10.72	8.28	10	7.6	8.46	7.0	8.8	84
4237	6634	3	Well the features of the setting affects the cyclist is a lot of ways. Well when his water was is hot to drink He got some pebbles and stuck them, in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that it will dilute your spit. The terrain of the story was very rocky and hilly. Those are the features of the terrain.	1	1		1																						64	5	70	1	0	0	4.0	12.8	13	7	2	3	2	6	42	3.8	4.51	6.0	6	3.6	5.12	5.4	3.1	76

He got scared he was going to die because had he drunk all his water and he didn’t know how long it would be till he got some more. He shouldn’t have drank his water so quickly knowing he had a while to go. Then he became happy when he saw the bait sign. He biked quickly down the hill.	1	1		1																						77	5	82	0	0	0	3.8181818181818183	15.4	9	18	5	7	1	7	47	4.3	4.17	6.04	2	4.6	6.16	6.7	3.1	91
4249	6646	3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal.

4257	6654	3	In the essay “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is affect both positivly and negativly by the setting. Setting is the sounding in which the story tacks place. In the story a cyclist loses his way and band is put in to dangous because of it. The setting of the story can be dicrided as mountainous with many rolling hills. The author discride the setting by say “@CAPS1 two miles in to the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” The change in terrain made it more difical for the cyclist. However he also used the land to give him hope that he was almost their. He told him self that he’d make it if he make it over the next hill. The setting of the story gave the cyclist hope and problems in his journy to sarive.	1	1		1																						146	10	155	2	0	0	4.239726027397261	14.6	37	17	9	5	4	21	88	7.7	6.85	7.57	21	6.9	8.69	11.2	8.1	193
4259	6656	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by rush he /she got when speeding down the hill. The fresh morning air, no limits just you and your feet.

4261	6658	3	“@CAPS1 directions, June, lack of water” all are elements that effect the rider on his ride. He took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut. I turned out that their short cut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California. It would have been burning hot. Lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip. He could have died if he didn’t find the other water source. These were some elements that effected the rider on his trip.	2	2		2																						90	8	101	3	0	0	4.355555555555555	11.25	24	11	7	1	0	13	49	4.7	6.01	6.83	9	4.2	6.3	5.375	8.1	119

4271	6668	3	The cyclist had alot of problems with his setting. It was very hot and he started getting low on water. This caused him to become dehydrated. There was hardly any civilization so no one could come to his aid.

4282	6679	3	As he began his journey, he had full confidence in the directions given given to him by the old men. After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on. After he found an “ramshackle shed” he became troubled , as he “had been “hitting“ his “water bottles regularly“ and was traveling through the “desert of California in June” and was running low on water. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he “manuevered” his way down, only to find it long  deserted and himself close to despair. He was desparate for water he needed it soon. Finally, he came upon “@CAPS1 and Wilber’s Fish Camp” and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on  he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling.	2	2		2																						142	7	158	8	0	0	4.333333333333333	20.571428571428573	27	24	10	7	8	27	80	9.4	7.66	7.21	16	8.8	9.74	11.2	9.2	192
4286	6683	3	Dry, thirsty, tedious-all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, everything is dry. The cyclist isnt any where near a town that could help him. He has been pedaling in the heat, outside for a long time. Secondly, He is very thirsty. The way he is travelling is a good sign he is in need of water. He went fourty miles before he reached the first town to stop at. He also is on a bike, So that doesn’t leave him much room to carry water along. Lastly, the trip is tedious. He has been going for forty miles, and the speed limit is 55. He hasn’t acceded 12 mph. All to gether, the cyclists trip seems to be adventure that takes a lot of heart.	1	1		1																						128	12	152	9	0	0	4.1484375	10.666666666666666	29	14	10	6	1	23	73	3.5	4.62	7.25	14	3.9	5.53	4.4	7.2	162
4295	6692	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can’t go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he’s relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn’t really know where he was going because there wasn’t a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first “town” as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and he’s only 12 he knows that he’s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																						117	7	128	4	0	0	4.273504273504273	16.714285714285715	23	20	3	11	4	17	67	7.0	6.67	7.84	8	6.3	7.02	6.285714285714286	6.2	148
4306	6703	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the journey more dangerous and difficult. For example, in the reading it states that rediculously large, poisonous diamond back snakes. Blocked majority of the pavement. So, the cyclist had to keep his/her balance to ease past them. The terrian also changed into short, rolling hills, making it even more difficult.	1	1		1																						60	5	72	5	0	0	5.25	12.0	14	9	7	7	1	11	31	9.3	11.24	8.44	10	8.0	8.8	6.8	10.8	93
4308	6705	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	3		3																						230	14	263	17	0	0	4.769565217391304	16.428571428571427	61	41	11	11	6	34	128	9.3	9.28	7.26	33	7.3	8.82	6.625	9.6	328
4312	6709	3	In the story the author says, “The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.” The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water.	2	2		2																						136	8	145	4	0	0	4.125	17.0	30	25	1	7	6	13	78	9.4	6.45	7.43	17	8.6	11.14	11.2	9.7	177
4319	6716	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead” plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn’t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road.

4321	6718	3	The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a rough undergoing story about a cyclist going though rough climate and terrain. In this story the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for about as far for human eyes could see. In paragraph @NUM1 the text says “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke.” is empressed how the climate felt. This explains the heat and how he felt during this experience. This whole trip sounds suffering.	1	1		1																						89	5	95	1	0	0	4.808988764044944	17.8	25	17	4	4	3	12	42	10.1	9.8	9.13	20	7.9	9.82	10.1	9.4	124
4335	6732	3	The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story “do not exceed posted speed limit” It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California all worn down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated. It says in the essay “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a georgus day in June simply because I listend to some gentlemen.” this explains on how simply exhausted he had become due to the miles of cycling, and the beating down sun and total lack of water due to absence of all towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhausgen because of the faulty directions of the old people. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions.	2	2		2																						168	6	177	3	0	0	4.470238095238095	28.0	48	22	14	6	5	16	86	13.6	8.59	8.69	28	11.8	13.82	15.0	11.9	237

He is doing something that be lovers, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confidentin the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted.Though at first he laughs it off, he laster realizes just how much trouble he in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates.

4339	6736	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The “towns” he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldn’t get more water or a place to rest. “I was doing a water depleating @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel”. This shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																						92	5	96	0	0	0	4.413043478260869	18.4	24	15	6	2	5	10	54	10.8	8.25	8.38	14	9.9	12.24	13.5	11.2	130

The cyclist takes directions from older guys who look like they haven’t left their porches in ages. He takes their advice and he then sukkers in the long run because he cannot find water and it is a hot @DATE1. He hikes uphills in the heating sun and fears a heat stroke.

In the story, it continues to talk about lack of water. “When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery @NUM1). This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down. But a good way it affect them is pebbles. ""I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to @NUM2). This shows that even though he has no water the pebbles can make him less thirsty. This is how the setting affects the cyclist.

In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to Yosemite National Park greatlly affected the cyclist. One the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road weren’t the most comfortable to be riding on. There was nothing insight for the cyclist to see. The cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for him. The author states, “…  gaining elevation while loosing hope.” Last the weather was hot and dry which tired the cyclist out. He had no water with him and with the weather he had no energy or hope to help him through the journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																						202	13	216	1	0	0	4.463054187192118	15.615384615384615	59	23	14	10	7	18	108	8.1	7.94	6.5	20	6.3	8.11	8.5	8.8	271
4352	6749	3	I am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him. The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot & drinking his water & he would soon run out of water & dehydrate. For example in the story the cyclist would always bring up the little bit of water he had left & around the essay he talked about the dehydration he was seeing & even death. Another example is the relif he had when he drink the water from the sink. In conclusion, this is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						98	5	104	1	0	0	4.173469387755102	19.6	22	14	2	4	5	7	55	8.6	7.54	6.26	9	9.4	9.59	11.6	10.8	138
4354	6751	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states “This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town.” This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist.	2	3		3																						216	8	230	4	0	0	4.398148148148148	27.0	49	33	11	11	6	18	123	14.7	8.48	7.65	23	11.8	13.66	19.0	10.6	283
4355	6752	3	The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he’s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted.	2	2		2																						161	10	170	2	0	0	4.3105590062111805	16.1	28	23	13	13	9	12	103	12.3	7.67	7.32	12	10.2	13.45	15.0	12.5	205
4356	6753	3	The setting was very hot dry and was a desert. This setting effected him be it was making him very dehidarted and hot. It was very hard for him to go any fourther but he knew he had to keep going. Also the land was very barin and ething around. Clearlier the setting effected the biker.	1	1		1																						56	5	61	0	0	0	4.125	11.2	8	10	5	6	4	10	36	3.6	4.97	6.17	5	4.1	6.62	5.4	8.2	73
4362	6759	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they don’t ride as much anymore and don’t know the best routes to take. So they just take their old routes, thinking they are still the better way, but when they use them they realize how tiring and bad they are.	1	1		1																						50	2	54	2	0	0	4.36	25.0	7	8	5	6	3	5	30	11.6	7.84	8.03	7	8.3	10.8	13.0	0.0	61
4363	6760	3	“At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..” being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel. The sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point. The sign that said “Rough @CAPS1 ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” had to be intimidating. Considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast. Those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office. yes like the writer said “the world is a fluid place.  Things  change.” The old men probably had close to no due what they were talking about considering things have changed since @NUM1 (when carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, must have been rather intimidating. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more. In eseance I think the setting was a major part why the cyclist felt that way	3	2		3																						165	11	184	3	0	0	4.299401197604791	15.181818181818182	34	27	10	10	3	23	92	9.3	7.14	6.95	17	7.8	9.45	11.0	8.8	213
4366	6763	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. When she was riding it was very hot this caused the cyclist to lose energy and dehydrate. Also when the cyclist went through a terrain change. The road changed into rolling hills. This caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired. Also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water. Eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated. This whole situation implied to stick to your original plan. If the cyclist would have done that she wouldn’t have had to go through the hardships.	2	2		2																						109	9	118	0	0	0	4.568807339449541	12.11111111111111	22	19	7	6	3	10	64	6.1	7.87	6.99	12	5.6	7.41	5.333333333333333	8.2	149
4368	6765	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist’s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he @MONTH1 not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let  down for the cyclist’s mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned.	2	3		3																						121	7	136	5	0	0	5.0	17.428571428571427	28	16	10	10	10	17	61	10.9	10.9	9.06	23	8.9	9.9	10.166666666666666	11.2	179
4374	6771	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the speaker is biking through some rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention long distances. He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen” (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey.	2	2		2																						134	6	148	5	0	0	4.835820895522388	22.333333333333332	41	17	13	5	3	17	62	12.5	10.39	8.98	27	9.6	11.91	11.6	11.2	190
4376	6773	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						87	5	94	0	0	0	4.057471264367816	17.4	19	13	3	2	5	6	52	6.4	5.57	6.13	5	5.4	6.96	7.9	5.7	106

4393	6790	3	In the story ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting seemed to affect the main character (the cyclist) very much during his pedal, for example, whole the dry desert setting made him think that he could survive with out water, he became dehydrated. The first town, with @NUM1 degree watter could not satisfy his standards. The old velches June factory, was all run down, and is no longer in business, much like the desert, just old barren unuseland.

4394	6791	3	There are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist. One feature is that it is getting hotter and it will eventually effect him. The line “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirge.” shows that the heat  might be starting to effect him. Another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water. The line “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says “and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated. Those are some of the many features that effect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						155	10	166	1	0	0	4.160256410256411	15.6	34	21	8	5	4	15	93	6.9	6.2	6.93	14	6.5	8.17	8.0	8.5	207

This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, ”I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.” @CAPS1 feature of the setting was the desolet towns that didn’t contain any water. This lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to sucking on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulates. @CAPS1 features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch’s Grape factory. This  factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state. The narrator called the factory.”Ironic  twist.”	3	3		3																						160	8	173	4	0	0	4.4753086419753085	20.25	43	26	12	3	3	20	87	11.3	8.65	8.23	21	8.7	11.16	10.8	10.3	215
4431	6828	3	The features of the setting could affect this cyclist. In this case it do effect the cyclist.

4435	6832	3	In the short story, Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting effects the cyclist in the story. For example, the dry hot air begins to  slowly dehidrate him, causing the cyclist to lose all sense of reason, the heat also played tricks on his mind. Also, the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them. This, also with the heat factor, caused him to use up his much needed water supply.

4445	6842	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. The speed limit sign makes him feel like life is cruel. His first glimpse of the welch's Juice factory makes him feel excited. Meeting the deserted fork in the road makes him feel troubled. When he finally gets there, he feels relieved. These are all examples showing that features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																						63	6	71	1	0	0	4.841269841269841	10.5	17	13	6	2	0	7	28	6.6	8.56	7.92	10	5.0	6.1	5.25	8.8	88
4447	6844	3	The features setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn’t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and how much he could ride.	1	1		1																						120	6	127	1	0	0	4.391666666666667	20.0	26	17	5	8	3	10	78	9.2	7.83	6.73	12	8.7	8.67	11.0	9.3	166
4453	6850	3	Hot, terrain, middle of nowhere- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the hot weather in California made the cyclist thirsty and almost dehydrated. There was no place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad and warm. Second, the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere. He couldn’t get water to hydrate himself or to sit down and rest.	2	1		2																						82	6	94	6	0	0	4.646341463414634	13.666666666666666	17	12	8	8	6	14	47	7.3	8.17	6.43	8	6.3	6.94	6.666666666666667	8.3	115
4460	6857	3	The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be “There was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is “wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who haden’t been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly.	2	2		2																						160	5	173	7	0	0	4.6625	32.0	42	18	7	6	5	15	95	16.5	9.93	8.48	26	13.4	14.55	11.4	11.6	226
4462	6859	3	The settings and features are very important to cyclists one because water and food try might carry a waterbottle and a snack but they need to know  where they are going and if they will need to bring extra or not. In the story I just read he didn’t bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble. Its important that a cyclist knows where their going and whats around them so they don't get lost and have no acsess to food or water.	2	1		2																						94	4	100	0	0	0	4.021052631578947	23.75	16	15	3	4	10	7	63	13.3	6.57	7.2	7	12.0	13.37	17.0	9.7	119
4471	6868	3	The setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first place he arrived at was a “ghost town” Then he reach a water pump about twenty miles up the road. The water was very hot and tasted very nasty. The text states, “…water feeting somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees…when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. Then he had to travel without water and became dehydrated. Travelling up and down hills he thought he began to imaginate a building that could possibly provide he with water. The building was there but it was abandoned. He decide he was going to such on a couple of pebbles. The text says, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thrist…”	2	2		2																						134	10	148	3	0	0	4.262773722627737	13.7	32	22	7	10	5	20	77	6.6	6.95	7.67	17	5.6	7.45	7.142857142857142	8.2	175
4476	6873	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” the cyclist sees many different settings when he left it was early summer and it was pretty hot outside. He rode into the morning when would make him tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town so that means he could rest get his supplies. Then he arrive by cool pines and rushing river which probably makes him feel releaxed. Then he showed up at a ramshack shed with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldn’t hold in the lamest made. Gated men which people made him feel uncocleible, and the pumps did not give him water so that was nobody also pointing. Then he was rideing through the California deserts in June witch probably made him more dehirrated.	2	2		2																						132	8	140	1	0	0	4.462121212121212	16.5	27	24	12	9	4	13	73	9.0	8.24	7.92	17	7.1	8.77	7.833333333333334	8.8	175
4481	6878	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist. It was a hot June day and the water supplies he had was running out. He got the wrong directions homThese old men so he would had to ride  his bike longer than he had to and he would need water from pedaling all that way for nothing. Since he was going in the wrong direction there were no buildings for him to get water, there were no people so he couldn’t communicate and there would be no one to call for help incase he was over heated from the heat.	2	2		2																						108	5	114	1	0	0	4.08256880733945	21.8	24	17	5	3	3	11	66	11.4	6.56	7.75	13	10.3	12.65	14.0	10.1	140
4500	6897	3	The dessert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, their would be no refills because the pump was only giving “ tarlike substance” said the text. With the lack of water dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the “ ridiculously large snake” he had seen. A finale effect would be mirages that could loose your judgement. This man double checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by “[wipping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage,” Through all the toughest desser obsticles the character was able to take the short cut and survive heat, dehydration, and animals of the dessert.	2	2		2																						137	7	152	6	0	0	4.700729927007299	19.571428571428573	37	17	10	4	3	22	71	10.5	9.28	8.18	24	8.6	10.18	7.142857142857142	10.3	193
4502	6899	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very sevior situation. The cyclist was in a desert. Like terria, which was not dinsely populated on his trail, there was a lack of fresh water supplys, and the tempatures is more extreme. The cyclist could easily have faintid from heatstroke, due to the lack of water and excessive heat and work that his was doing peatling. Had the area been more populated, he would have had more chances to stock up on water greatly indecriasing his risk of heat stroke. There was also the snakes which presentid danger for him, has he been bitting then he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the closet help which could proven fetal. Had the setting been, say a city park, on a populated country side, them thi setting would had provided exponeutaly loss prodioms and dangers for the cyclist.	3	2		3																						154	7	171	10	0	0	4.62987012987013	22.0	43	15	12	9	4	26	89	11.4	8.88	8.73	26	9.5	12.44	10.166666666666666	11.8	218
4503	6900	3	The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says “and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June”. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says “I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul”. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.	2	2		2																						94	3	100	3	0	0	4.505263157894737	31.666666666666668	20	18	3	3	5	11	51	15.7	9.47	8.91	14	13.0	15.41	18.333333333333332	12.5	134
4506	6903	3	On the cyclists rideto Yosemite National Park he encouters a lot of hardships due to the setting hes around and the advice given by oldmen. The cyclist riding his bike in the middle of June in the deserts of california isnt good to begin with adding to cyclist dehydration state. He first come to encouters ''one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn`t hold in the lament mule'' By that description oF his lecatracy it seems as if he might be in ghost town by himself almost could strand him. He described the terrain with “short, rolling hils.'' and ''over one long, crippling hill.'' This shows some of the obstacle that he had to go through in a bike, just to get to Yosemite National Park. He @CAPS1 realized once he encounterd these Features oF the terrain that he was oFF track and needed to find help. After his survival of his surroundings For as long as he could go, @CAPS1 gets help at a real camp. That is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist epidemic.	2	2		2																						184	10	206	6	0	0	4.4728260869565215	18.4	53	21	9	9	4	24	106	11.1	8.07	8.98	27	8.7	11.37	14.0	10.1	243
4513	6911	3	The setting of this story affects the cyclist alot. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run-down out of dated town which didnt help him when he was lost. The town is out of date and hot. Which bring another problem, the cyclist was dehydrating because he didnt have enough water. He would hilusinate and see things that werent there. He become very tired in the hot sun. So the setttling in this short stories effected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																						85	7	98	1	0	0	4.411764705882353	12.142857142857142	18	13	7	4	2	11	53	5.4	6.83	6.84	11	4.5	5.78	5.5	6.9	112
4515	6913	3	The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat smoot terrain, when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. The biker said “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot. he was sweating and getting dehydrated, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst.” he had eighteen miles to next town without much water. The first deserted town didn’t have any drinkable water. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going.	2	2		2																						119	8	132	5	0	0	4.3277310924369745	14.875	24	25	13	5	3	16	64	7.5	6.78	8.19	14	6.4	8.14	6.571428571428571	8.0	151
4517	6915	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn’t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn’t have been so worried. What’s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn’t have struggled so much at the end. “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.	2	3		3																						186	8	196	0	0	0	4.577540106951871	23.375	43	24	7	12	7	18	108	13.5	9.23	8.27	26	11.3	13.01	11.0	11.5	255
4518	6916	3	The features  of the setting affect the cyclist in that it made him use up his water supply and tested his determination. “ Sometimes life can be so cruel” implies that he was having a horrible time coping with the setting he was in. To himself he thought be was gonna die at any moment.	1	1		1																						55	3	60	0	0	0	4.160714285714286	18.666666666666668	13	10	1	1	1	6	33	12.2	7.14	7.87	9	11.7	12.45	14.75	0.0	77
4528	6926	3	”Do not Exceed the posted speed limit” tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of “the serenity of an early summer evening,” and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the “town” he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclist’s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.	3	3		3																						222	10	248	13	0	0	4.709821428571429	22.4	65	40	13	6	12	30	105	13.2	9.93	8.99	41	11.7	12.94	9.0	12.1	326
4532	6930	3	The complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story. His trip goes from bad to worse as he progresses to Yosemite. After taking directions from the “old codgers,” the author attempts the shortcut, but is dissapointed. He arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted. He rubbed it off though, and kept “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” as his motivation. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued. Just as if things couldn’t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope. He became even more of a pessimist when “a ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavement…” He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned. He even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration. When he finally found the fish camp, he was relieved. All the obstacles he prospered through were worth in the end.	2	1		2																						189	13	212	12	0	0	4.626315789473685	14.615384615384615	39	33	13	9	11	31	103	8.3	8.64	7.85	30	7.1	9.49	7.428571428571429	9.9	267
4539	6937	3	The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main charater is biking throug a desert in the summer with little water. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will sarley die. The main character says, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main characters energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main characters biggest problem is the heat of the setting.	2	2		2																						131	8	141	3	0	0	4.694656488549619	16.375	37	15	12	2	3	14	64	10.0	9.46	8.06	22	8.2	9.62	8.666666666666666	10.9	189
4541	6939	3	All the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strerigth. It seems like he might have collapsed it he hadn't thought he was going to @CAPS1, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him.	2	2		2																						92	6	108	7	0	0	4.141304347826087	15.333333333333334	18	14	3	3	3	13	62	5.7	5.1	7.31	11	5.7	7.86	7.333333333333334	7.8	118
4546	6944	3	In the story “Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting seem negative to the cyclist. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next @NUM1 miles easily. For example the cyclist says “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, “the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aern’t going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist later on the cyclist ends up saying “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you.	2	3		3																						164	9	174	2	0	0	4.347560975609756	18.22222222222222	36	31	13	6	2	20	88	10.8	7.78	8.36	23	8.9	11.07	13.75	9.2	218
4554	6952	3	At times when the features of the setting are bad it can have a great impact on the cyclist. For one if it’s too hot the cyclist is going to need plenty of water if he/she does'nt want to be dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat strokes and deadly snakes, cyclist might want to avoid that. When your a cyclist times can be hard just prepared for the long run.	1	1		1																						72	4	79	1	0	0	4.125	18.0	17	10	6	3	1	7	42	7.0	5.8	7.38	8	6.8	7.76	8.25	6.0	91

4576	6974	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first “town”, and described it as only having “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall” I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldn’t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist."	1	1		1																						180	5	206	17	0	0	4.733333333333333	36.0	49	27	18	8	8	33	89	18.8	9.88	8.84	24	15.0	15.73	18.666666666666668	12.0	256
4582	6980	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, “They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey.	1	1		1																						55	3	62	2	0	0	5.381818181818182	18.333333333333332	17	8	2	1	3	8	28	13.1	13.11	9.71	12	9.2	10.23	10.833333333333334	10.5	81
4583	6981	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit “the cyclist has some very rough obstacles on his way to Yosemite National park. With his lack of water and diredness he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black. He easily passes the snake and moves on. Being in the intense heat and with know water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he go's this way is because @NUM1 “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office”. These guys gave him wrong directions. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other stuff wouldn’t have happened if he payed attention to his surroundings and people around him.	2	2		2																						133	6	143	0	0	0	4.443609022556391	22.166666666666668	36	16	6	6	6	15	74	9.0	8.01	8.5	17	7.2	9.4	10.8	9.6	177
4584	6982	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch’s Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water $ be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of liFe or building. Therefore his surrouding throughout the story make him indifferent, confident & relieved.	3	2		3																						140	8	152	4	0	0	4.735714285714286	17.5	41	16	10	4	3	14	72	9.8	9.68	8.38	26	8.9	10.4	7.857142857142858	11.2	207
4588	6986	3	The setting in the short story; “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit” greatly affects the cyclist. The rough terrain and blazing sun test him and make him suffer in ways he never imagined. One point, after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes, “Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” this setting has caused the cyclist to become so dehydrated that he can’t think. The cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him. As you can see the setting has a very strong affect on the cyclist.	2	3		3																						109	6	121	3	0	0	4.336363636363636	18.333333333333332	26	20	6	6	2	17	56	8.3	7.25	7.73	13	6.8	7.65	7.5	5.5	140

4597	6995	3	The features like not enough water not enough sense of direction, effect the cyclist because he needs water to keep on peadiling. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going. From not enough water he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and there been sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that pargraph” That site ment that the old man’s sense of directin was out of date. They did not no where any thing was at just there in giant poarch.	1	1		1																						112	5	121	4	0	0	4.223214285714286	22.4	27	16	11	3	4	13	63	9.6	7.03	7.29	11	8.5	9.67	13.75	8.8	140
4603	7001	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all I think that when the cyclist came across the “ghost town” he felt alone and discouraged. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was. Overall I think that it had really physical and psycoligical effects on him.	2	2		2																						133	6	139	0	0	0	4.120300751879699	22.166666666666668	18	25	11	10	6	8	87	9.1	6.38	6.64	13	8.4	10.38	10.8	9.3	170
4610	7008	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try  forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were “I was going to die.” First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp. Her setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive.	1	1		1																						110	9	121	1	0	0	4.5675675675675675	12.333333333333334	29	16	6	8	4	15	64	6.3	7.93	6.97	12	4.5	5.97	5.75	6.9	147
4625	7023	3	In the poem “Do not exceed speed limit” the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake” This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.	1	1		1																						99	6	106	0	0	0	4.14	16.666666666666668	24	15	7	6	3	14	49	10.6	6.85	7.26	11	9.4	11.13	13.125	8.1	125
4628	7026	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was “traveling through the high desert of California in June” this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal.	2	3		3																						141	7	155	8	0	0	4.4822695035460995	20.142857142857142	32	19	13	6	4	22	79	9.7	8.12	7.88	22	7.6	10.88	11.2	10.3	188
4642	7040	3	The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit” affect the cyclist. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as “a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.” The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, “The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large” snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn’t give up and is relieved when he finally receives water.	3	3		3																						203	11	226	12	0	0	4.945812807881773	18.454545454545453	55	28	12	8	6	30	103	12.0	10.68	8.61	37	10.0	10.48	7.7142857142857135	11.0	299
4643	7041	3	The features of the desert changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. When the road began the change, the speaker’s determination did too, “Flat road were replaced by short hills”. The terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut. “I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listned to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades”. The heat in desert made the speaker thirsty causing him to drink all his water. There was no source of water therefore he decided to suckenc-stone. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst”,. But the bumpy terrain didn’t allow him to do that. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker began to panice, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”. But luckily the author thoughts changed after he found a supply of water, the features did affect the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																						175	9	190	5	0	0	4.571428571428571	19.444444444444443	51	32	5	7	5	22	91	9.8	8.65	7.94	20	7.3	8.67	10.6	7.8	228
4649	7047	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn’t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn’t in a “ghost town”, with the, “sun beggining to beat down”. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, “about forty miles into the petal”, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot.	2	2		2																						115	7	128	7	1	0	4.104347826086957	16.428571428571427	27	10	9	9	4	21	70	6.1	5.45	7.61	10	5.0	7.6	7.833333333333334	6.9	141

4652	7050	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for “rough road ahead,” @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging.	3	3		3																						117	11	133	7	0	0	5.2905982905982905	10.636363636363637	31	19	8	8	2	21	57	9.3	11.23	8.81	27	7.9	10.49	6.444444444444445	11.6	188
4654	7052	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																						87	6	93	0	0	0	4.172413793103448	14.5	18	9	6	5	5	5	54	5.5	5.91	5.99	6	5.4	6.26	6.916666666666667	7.8	114
4658	7056	3	"After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,”water-deplating” one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as “rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrator’s hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally."	2	3		3																						113	8	129	6	0	0	4.778761061946903	14.125	28	18	4	9	5	16	62	9.2	9.34	7.79	17	8.4	9.27	8.666666666666666	10.6	164
4662	7060	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of no where, he couldn’t get any water. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,” he was so thirsty that he barely had any energy to keep going, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” it was hot out and he had no water so this affected his energy.	1	1		1																						75	3	80	4	0	0	4.293333333333333	25.0	16	14	3	3	1	10	46	17.5	7.67	8.87	9	14.4	16.6	20.75	0.0	98
4664	7062	3	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him.	1	1		1																						65	6	74	3	0	0	4.2	10.833333333333334	13	6	3	6	3	9	43	3.8	5.08	6.6	6	2.8	5.55	4.75	6.4	79
4665	7063	3	The setting desented in the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer’s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.	2	2		2																						127	8	143	6	0	0	4.622047244094488	15.875	34	16	7	4	4	21	70	8.3	8.47	7.91	20	6.0	9.51	8.5	9.5	170
4668	7066	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advise from people that no longer drive or even leave of the porch would be unuseful. When the author say “old timers who haven’t lest the confined of them porches since carter was in office” that what he is explaining. He then say “I rode  into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face” he was refering back to how hes  on the rode  alone riding the bike and theres not a car insight any where around. The curbs of the turns where so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safe as he did “He whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn’t mirage and tried not get to excited” @CAPS1 in this situation would have made many people excited about the long lonely cicle by his self.	2	2		2																						151	4	160	0	0	0	4.162337662337662	38.5	32	22	9	11	4	15	93	17.4	7.61	8.54	15	14.5	16.44	13.5	11.2	194

I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip.

4678	7076	3	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If it’s too hot, you’re going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If it’s all down hill, it’s really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out.

4680	7078	3	The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist. First, it is a very hot dry in June.

4683	7081	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because at first he had to watch out for the snakes that usually crossed the roads, then the streets were crooked and bumpy, so the road structure throw him off a bit, and he was riding his bike in June and it was very hot, and he had lack of water so he thought he was going to have a heatstroke.

""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" The cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is ""troubling."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic. Farther down the road, the terrain of the road changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name."" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting @NUM1.

''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn`t been off their porch in decades.''

4741	7139	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June.Their is also a lack of water, some must pace his sips carefully. Therefore also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life.  The dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey.

Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town “I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.’ This quote means that he wasn’t expecting hills, he thought it was going o be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features.	2	1		2																						123	8	138	3	0	0	4.390243902439025	15.375	29	23	7	2	1	14	63	8.0	7.31	8.49	17	6.6	8.34	10.8	8.0	162
4753	7151	3	The setting in the story was the “high deserts of California in June.” At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldn’t make it he saw a sign that said “Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp” He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” and “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” So this brought self doubting behavior.	3	3		3																						261	14	274	0	0	0	4.088122605363985	18.642857142857142	56	44	19	12	13	23	145	8.7	6.09	7.5	21	7.1	9.64	8.0	8.3	325

Below the mooring mast would be several other buildings were other people worked and lived. If something happened while he dirigible was attempting to dock, it could take out the building and the lives of the people in it. Not only that, but below were the city streets, where pedestrians walked. In paragraphs @NUM2, the passage also talks about the stress of a heavy, steel framed airship mooring at the top of the building. The frame would need to be very dense and, as the architects of the project discovered expensive. Other safety issues include the high winds that would drift the dirigibles off course, and the safety of dirigibles themselves.

Alsoif  the blimp was moving, how would passangers get on and off? They could fall off the loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp.

8973	14923	6	In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and could cause the dirigible to swerve. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be unsafe. At any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. Which could also cause harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																						168	12	191	11	0	0	4.7976190476190474	14.0	47	22	12	7	5	19	92	8.2	9.16	7.71	29	6.4	8.7	7.2857142857142865	10.3	243

9011	14961	6	In the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, obsticals of the Empire State Building faced to attempemt to allow dirigibles to dock there were enginering challenges. A problem with the docking was that the building was complete before the idea came to mind. A second problem was that the whole skeletal structure had to be changed in order for dirigibles to be able to dock. Then the question on how the airships, dirigibles, would stay next to the building. These were harder problem after it was illigale to have dirigibles to be close to buildings as well. Plus the fact that if they crash they are flamable and could kill people. Those are some facts that made it difficult for the Empire State building to build a dirigibles docks in the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.	3	3		3																						141	7	155	7	0	0	4.702127659574468	20.142857142857142	42	16	10	4	2	17	77	10.8	9.4	7.66	22	8.8	9.74	11.6	10.0	201

This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for Dirigibles.In building the mooring mast, came obstacles. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth. Lead weights were typically used to keep from swaying, but if used here, lead weights would be dangling @NUM1 ft above pedestrians heads. Which leads to safety being another obstacle. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable, if ignited, the possibly largest accident would occur to New York City. The Final obstacle is the law. There is a law that states ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas."" Which would make the mooring mast's purpose illegal.

9105	15055	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's back and to blow sideways and puncture on the tops of other buildings. On top of that, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked or collapsed the building and its foundation. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease production of the mast, because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers.	2	3		3																						118	5	131	6	0	0	5.11864406779661	23.6	35	14	9	9	5	12	62	14.5	12.07	9.89	26	11.3	14.86	13.0	13.7	180

In order to make New York City the most modern city for travel, Al Smith attempted to put a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. They did finish constructing the mooring mast, although the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened. The stress of the people boarding the dirigible could cause damage to the original framework. Once it was finished, there were @NUM1 attempts the board passengers onto the blimps. Although, they both ended in failure. The builders were not able to overcome the obstacles of the severe winds and laws. Winds could blow the blimp strayed into another building. Also, if a dirigible made of hydrogen was used, it could cause a fatal accident due to the high flammability of it. Finally, there was an existing law that airships from flying close to urban areas.

9144	15094	6	Based on the excerpt from the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in building the mooring mast. For example, there was actually a law that prohibited exactly what the builders wanted. The law said that airships could not fly too low over city areas. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building would directly violate that law when the ships come in to dock. Another problem the builders faced was the danger surrounding the airships that would be docking there. The airships, called dirigibles, were like giant balloons and could pop if they touched something sharp enough. The Empire State Building was surrounded by other extremely tall buildings and most of them had long spires on top. Therefore, if the dirigible bumps one of these spires, it could pop and go plummeting to the ground. This presented another problem. Had an airship popped in New York City, it could've killed a large number of people not only in it, but on the ground. During the time of building, the Hindenburg crashed into fields, killing all of it's passengers. The builders thought what the consequences would be if that had happened in the city. This was the final straw for the builders as they abandoned their lofty goal, because of too many problems.	3	4		4																						222	13	248	11	0	0	4.8558558558558556	17.076923076923077	63	31	13	10	4	23	121	10.0	9.92	7.97	35	7.6	9.9	9.0	10.0	305

The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast.

As the author points out, there were many problems with this idea. The reasons were: safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If a dirigibles burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be violent and unpredicting. This would make it difficult to land at the mooring station and if it successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigibles would be blown around by the wind. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city. This law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into city. With all of these problems, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively."	3	4		4																						226	12	252	9	0	0	4.84070796460177	18.833333333333332	59	26	16	10	3	23	129	10.8	10.15	7.59	34	8.3	10.19	10.166666666666666	10.5	324
9286	15236	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles while trying to build the mast. One problem was that there was a lot of pressure and stress that would be put on the building if a dirigible was to dock there. This was because of the high wind speeds and of the sheer size of the dirigible. The designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework to account for the pressure. Another obstacle was that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that the dirigibles would not be allowed to even get close to the building, let alone dock on it. Eventually, these obstacles and other safety issues, such as hydrogen inside, the blimp being highly flammable, caused the idea to dissappear.	3	2		3																						138	7	151	5	0	0	4.666666666666667	19.714285714285715	33	18	10	8	3	12	82	10.4	9.23	8.16	23	8.6	10.49	8.5	10.6	195

Their dream put New York on the forefront of modern travel never was fulfilled.     First, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework because of the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, which would add stress to the frame. However, one of the greatest obstacles the builders encountered was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable and could be very dangerous, especially in highly populated areas such as New York. Also, the violent winds on top of the building made it impossible to keep the dirigibles stable and not swiveling around the mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down dirigibles that moored in the field, but this would be unsafe dangling from a building. Finally the idea violated a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All of the contributing obstacles the builders faced made their dream of using the mooring mast for dirigibles unsuccessful.	4	4		4																						186	9	207	9	0	0	5.064171122994653	20.77777777777778	56	24	14	12	4	21	98	14.1	11.78	8.61	36	11.2	12.55	12.8	13.2	288

It was the practice at the time to control the back of the dirigible with lead weights but over a civilian area this was ""neither practical nor safe.""Another important reason why the builders faced obstacles was the already existing law that prohibited low-flying aircraft over cities.

9362	15312	6	The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable The death toll would be astronaumical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are to many obstacles prohibiting it.	3	3		3																						164	9	176	4	0	0	4.932926829268292	18.22222222222222	50	18	14	9	3	14	84	10.9	10.85	8.29	31	10.4	11.67	11.5	13.0	257

9380	15330	6	four main obstacles prevented dirigibles from ever docking at the Empire State Building. The first was that a much more complex mooring mast would have to be installed on top of the Empire State Building, a very different mast than the regular masts found in open field docking areas. When a dirigible would dock on the mast cause great stress to the building's frame, a problem that could be solved by increasing the strength of the steel frame. Another problem was that a dirigible was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode. Engineers saw this would cause large problems over a densly populated area like, New York City. Once the mast was built a new problem arised, even if the dirigible could dock the intense winds could make the back end of the dirigible move violently, or cause an airship to be unable to dock, like the inncodent with the Los Angeles. Nor could they use lead weights to weigh down the ballon since they would be a danger to civilians. Lastly, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas could have prevented docking. These reasons made it impossible for a ship to ever moor on top of the Empire state Building, although two ships got very close.	4	4		4																						213	9	231	8	0	0	4.63849765258216	23.666666666666668	60	27	18	13	4	18	111	12.3	9.41	8.3	33	10.2	11.92	12.4	11.6	295

This created lots of unnecessary work for the workers, as well as made obstacles.There was also a lot of danger associated with docking dirigibles that the builders had to deal with. The violent changing air currents would require them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the movement of the dirigibles. Finally the builders find out the biggest obstacle which is that it is legal for airships to fly that low over urban areas, so technically they weren't even allowed to do what they did.

They had to put in sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to its framework. Also having the right equipment on the dirigibles served as a problem. The dirigibles didn't have the right docking tools to dock on this newly built mooring mast. The back of the dirigibles could also be swung back and forth when docked which also served as a issue When it came to docking.

The stress of the blimps load, and wind pressure had to have been sent all the way to the base of the building which was @DATE1 ft. below. Another problem that aroused later was that other blimps outside the United States were made w/hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flamable. Now since the German blimp, the Hindenburg, blew up by fire over @CAPS1, New Jersey, architectes are now worried that it will be a bad idea to do this b/c if it happened over @LOCATION3 city then many more lives would be in danger. Also yet another obstacle came up due to nature itself. The winds @ the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent wind currents. Even if the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the rear end of the blimp would be all over the place. Thats why now, blimps dock on the ground and are held down by weights on @NUM1 sides. One other reason that this is a problem is that docking a blimp @ the Empire State Building would be illegal due to the case that it is flying to low to the ground.

Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it illegal.

So with that they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building yet until they did some major adjustments. With that big problem the builders next obstacle was to design and build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.

The first obstacle was concern of public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable element. An accident in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic. The second obstacle were the violent winds on top of the building. Using lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not practical, because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A mishap would send those heavy weights flying down and causing destruction. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

For example: ""Most dirgibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium"" (paragraph @NUM1) This was dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for some reason an accident occurred, it could be catastrophic over a densely populated city like New York. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a constant powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building creates. If a dirigible docked there, it would be blowing all over the place, if it could even dock at all. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights in the back, but this would be too dangerous to try over a city teeming with people. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""

9501	15451	6	When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the buildings framework. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																						137	8	149	3	0	0	4.751824817518248	17.125	41	16	11	3	3	10	77	9.5	9.45	7.83	25	7.6	10.05	9.0	10.4	193
9508	15458	6	The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building definitely faced some large and overwhelming complications when trying to build it to allow the dockings of dirigibles, or blimps. First off, from their original plan, right off the bat, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building was taller. so they had to come up with something fast to fix that. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, @LOCATION1 had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against it, so the whole idea was basically tossed. And to make matters worse, the violent gusts of air and updrafts wouldn't make docking on the Empire State Building very safe for passengers.	2	2		2																						125	5	140	9	0	0	4.928	25.0	30	16	12	9	6	16	70	17.4	11.15	9.1	26	14.3	17.96	22.333333333333332	15.6	186

9515	15465	6	The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.	3	3		3																						257	15	272	1	0	0	4.669260700389105	17.133333333333333	63	37	17	14	4	15	146	9.1	9.16	7.62	37	7.6	9.33	7.7142857142857135	10.5	364

After the hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would of been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as @CAPS1 (paragraph @NUM2).  It wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though.  Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast.  The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on it's back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because of the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph @NUM3).  The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place.

Another obstacle to allow dirigibles was the mast; an obstacle of the mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern was safety, nature itself, and the existing laws of airships. Safety is a major factor when constructing. The builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium. Risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is. Later realizing how bad it could of been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937. Could of happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, because the winds on top were shifting constantly. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around, aswell around the mooring mast. The final obatoce was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, and puncture the dirigible's shell. In two failed attemps they desided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."""	4	4		4																						224	13	258	6	0	0	5.022321428571429	17.23076923076923	63	30	16	11	2	29	114	10.8	10.67	9.21	51	8.8	10.45	7.0	11.1	336
9576	15526	6	The building of the Empire State building was a project which faced many obstacles. Due to the additional plan of building a mooring mast at the top of the building, A series of challenges and possibilities were forced to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the addition of a mooring mast to the top of the building, would significantly weigh down the building, adding stress to its frame. Because of this, over @MONEY1 worth modifications would have to be made to enforc the building's frame and stabilize it is a whole. Laws and regulations about how high airships could hoover over urban areas also restricted the use of the mast as because the building was located in the middle of a city, a densely populated area with thousands of pedestrians below, it was clearly neither practical, nor safe. Furthermore, Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the success of the mast as because many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, this risked a fire hazzard. Lastly, strong winds and violent air currents all in all prevented the construction of the mast, as using the top of the building as a dock for airships maybe just a bit far fetched.	4	4		4																						199	7	219	12	0	0	4.834170854271357	28.428571428571427	59	18	13	13	6	19	111	15.5	10.45	9.41	44	13.2	15.78	11.8	13.3	298

9595	15545	6	Although they made a valiant effort to make a seemingly ingenious idea into reality, the obstacles faced by the constructors of the Empire State Building in creating a dock for dirigibles proved to be insurmountable. One of the challenges faced by the builders was the tumutuous winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These forceful gales made it virtually impossible to manuever a dirigable at that elevation, much less dock it to a building. Another barrier that the architects faced was the fact that there was a law saying that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas. This meant that it would be even illegal for any dirigable even come close to the Empire State Building. Finally, the creators of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of safety: @CAPS1 are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a density populated urban area would have horrific results.	3	3		3																						158	6	169	4	0	0	4.987341772151899	26.333333333333332	43	20	13	11	1	13	82	15.2	11.49	9.54	37	12.4	15.84	16.75	14.8	244

9607	15557	6	When building the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, architects faced many obstacles, such as spontaneous combustion, nature, and airship related laws. The first issue faced by builders was spontaneous combustion. Due to the accidental fire on the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible lit up on their building, the results would be even worse, for debris would fall on the busy New York streets. A second issue builders faced was mother nature herself. Because of violent air currents, the winds above the building were constantly changing. Is would mean that even if docked and tethered, the back of the ship would still spin. Normally, lead weights held down dirigibles in fields, but over New York City would be dangerous for they could snap off and fall to the pedestrians below. Finally, there were laws set in place regulating airship flight that held back construction. These laws set a limit on heights above urban areas, making a dock to the Empire State building, or even just approaching it, illegal. Builders of the mast on the Empire State building faced many obstacles during construction, such as fires, nature, and the law.	3	3		3																						198	10	226	18	0	0	5.02020202020202	19.8	65	24	18	9	6	25	95	12.1	11.02	7.97	31	8.7	11.56	10.5	12.0	285

A dirigible floating in the middle of a largely populated area would be very unsafe.  Also a dirigible is made of hydrogen and helium and hydrogen is very flammable.  So if an accident happens and a dirigible was destroyed, people below would be dead.  Another obstacle was the law, Airships cannot fly too low over urban areas.  The greatest obsticle of them all though was nature itself The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

Because of the winds in New York, the dirigible would not be secured well, and many dirigibles would be destroyed instead of held in place. Lastly, there was the reason of the law. It the excerpt it explained that, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

The dirigibles were docked which meant that the electric winch, in which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast.

In new York City, there was a lack of suitable landing areas for the dirigibles. Now this would be a good idea for the Empire State Building. Landing on the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or other services. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The dirigible is thousand-foot long. It would add stress to the building's frame. Engineers soon designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. The mast had four wings at its corners. The building is now 102 floors. Floors @NUM1 and 102 were for the observation area to double as the boarding area for the dirigible passengers. Workers celebrate framing the entire building after two months. Now people lost their hope. It's because the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never to fulfill its purpose.

9694	15644	6	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Safety was a huge issue. Foreign derigibles often used hydrogen gas to stay aloft, which is highly flammable. A fire posed a dangerous threat in such a densely populated area as New York City. Another great obstacle was the turbulent wind at the elevation of the mooring mast, which would have prevented the dirigible from staying in one place. This would make it extremely difficult for passengers to safely board or exit the zeppelin. One way to solve this problem would be to weigh down the blimp with lead weights, but this was also a dangerous practice, because the weights could fall to the ground and crush those passing by. Although a mooring mast was in theory, a useful idea, it was neither safe nor practical.	3	3		3																						144	8	159	7	0	0	4.791666666666667	18.0	36	17	15	9	5	16	74	10.1	9.63	8.92	29	9.1	11.64	8.428571428571429	11.9	210

Because hydrogen is highly flammable there would be no way that would be safe. The building could catch of fire and be a danger for all.

The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents couldnt allow dirigibles to be on the Empire State Building because you can't have dirigibles with violent air currents. It isnt safe. Lastly, laws was an obstacle the builders had to face: Lüsted's knowledge is, ""The other practical lesson why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The law was a huge obstacle for the builders building the dirigibles. Because you can't build something with it being against the law.

It could not be dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance had to be done to the frame. A third problem they had was tying up the dirigibles, violent winds could turn the Blimp around, possibly puncturing it.

The mast, added to the top of the building, allows dirigibles to anchor For awhile to refuel and to have service done. This design took a while to develop + soon became bad. Saftey was a factor. Most dirigibles, from outside of the @LOCATION2. were run on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accedents. For example on May 6, 1937 German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like that would happen in a heavily populated area like @CAPS1 then there would be a problem. These were a couple of the many obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																						199	15	226	9	0	0	4.728643216080402	13.266666666666667	68	26	12	11	4	27	97	8.0	8.81	8.32	29	6.4	8.06	6.571428571428571	9.2	277
9797	15747	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first big obstacle was designing the mast. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building; it had a flat roof. If a dirigible was moored it would add additional stress to the frame, and wind pressure would be a factor as well. The mooring mast was never destined to fulfill the purpose of landing dirigibles, because it isn't safe, nature (dirigible with swivel in back) it could possibly be weighed down by lead in back but that cant be hung above pedestrians on the street. A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against air ships flying to low. Although, this had happened two dirigibles had attempted to moor there the first turned back due to bad weather conditions and the second one was as a publicity stunt had dropped off newspapers before the landing gear could be installed so they had to use a wire to recieve them. In result the idea was shelved.	3	3		3																						186	8	204	4	0	0	4.634408602150538	23.25	48	26	11	12	3	16	107	12.0	9.35	8.53	32	10.0	12.76	12.2	11.9	263

Al Smith decided that was a good idea to let dirigibles anchor on top of his building for some hours for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" But the dirigibles were docked by an electric winch that tied the ship to the mast. The dirigibles would swing and people would still get on and off safely. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building worked/talked with experts and got equipment ""and mooring operations oat the U.S. Naval Air Station"". which the navy was the leader in the development of dirigibles in the U.S. and knew everything. The Navy offered its dirigibles to be used for testing the mast.

One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers.

To fix this, the frame of the Empire state building would need to be strengthened.  Another problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below.  Dirigibles using hydrogen could burst into flames.  Also high winds would make it hard for the dirigible to tether to the mooring mast.  The dirigible could not be weighed down since the weights would dangle over pedestrians on the streets.

This was not an easy task; in fact it was never achieved. Some reasons for this are the very building itself. The mooring mast was to be on top of the building, and its height and weight and wind pressure on the building was dangerous. In paragraph nine it is stated that: ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" But even more than just the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York created a few major obstacles. First, most international blimps used Hydrogen rather than helium-which is highly Flammable. A fire or explosion in the location that the mooring mast was to be located would be devastating to the city. Secondly, there were shifting winds ""due to violent air currents"" atop the building. They caused the backend of the dirigible to swerve. Weights could not be used on the blimp, though, because of the people below and the height at which everything took place. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So essentially, the objective of this project could not be reached ed unless legislation was changed.

He said a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on.

Safty was a big issue because the blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with Hydrogen, which is highly flamable. It would be a huge disaster if one of them exploaded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were always changing and there was no way to keep the dirigibles from moving in the wind and it could be dangerous. There was, also, a law about how low you can fly over urban areas and in order to land correctly, you would be breaking that law, and flying that low would risk wind pusing the dirigible into the top of the building and puncturing it.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in trying to have dirigibles dock at the building. For example, one obstacle that is faced is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is an extremely flammable gas, and if a dirigible is destroyed by fire like the Hindenburg it could cause a terrible accident in a heavily populated area like New York. Therefore the builders face an obstacle of a safety issue with the dirigibles if one catches on fire in New York. Another important obstacle is that strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building causes the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, which causes the dirigibles to not get close enough to the mooring mass. Also the wind creates a risk that a dirigible could be blown onto a sharp spire of another building, ""and the dirigible could be punctured which causes a dangerous situation for the captain. To weigh down the dirigible so that it does not swivel as much in the wind, the controllers would have to use lead weights. Though the lead weights lessen the swiveling it is not practical or safe because lead weights would be hanging above pedestrians on the street, and if a lead weight fell it could be fatal. Lastly, if the dirigible to moor at the Empire State Building it would be breaking an existing law.

One problem was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. It would add unwanted stress to the building frame. Another issue was the gas used to fill the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being very flamable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densley populated area, downtown New York. Towards the top of the building, violent air currents caused another problem. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast. A final delema was an existing law that prohibited airships flying to low over urban areas, such as New York. Due to these obsticles, the ability to dock a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building was destined to @CAPS1.	4	3		4																						159	9	177	8	0	0	4.735849056603773	17.666666666666668	53	20	11	6	1	19	82	9.7	9.22	8.49	32	9.0	10.1	8.0	11.2	233

The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long Dirigible would a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and @MONEY1 of modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that forbid airships to fly too low over urban areas. the factor of nature made the mooring mast Idea completely @CAPS1. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to Violent air currents, even the capitain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible.

10211	16161	6	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to acommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly. Another obstacle the builders face was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.	4	4		4																						246	15	265	2	0	0	4.849593495934959	16.4	67	27	20	10	3	15	143	9.6	10.15	7.6	39	8.5	9.97	10.666666666666666	12.1	374
10216	16166	6	"In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many problems. One of the more obvious issues was that of the make-up of the dirigibles themselves. At the time, they consisted of hydrogen, which, although allowed for a lower density, was highly flammable. This concept was proven and brought to light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a famous dirigible. If a dirigible were to catch fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the civilians below. Another topic of debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such winds could easily cause a lack of stability for a dirigible which could in turn place added stress on the building itself. Another problem caused by winds is the fact that the dirigible might crash into other buildings, causing, the fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and the dirigible to crash. In the end, it was a project deemed too risky to continue."	3	3		3																						187	9	211	12	0	0	4.7967914438502675	20.77777777777778	56	20	11	6	3	22	101	11.6	9.81	8.97	36	10.2	11.31	10.333333333333334	12.3	278

These were the obstacles the builders faced in an attempt to create a mast and allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																						116	5	123	2	0	0	4.603448275862069	23.2	41	17	3	0	4	5	60	11.8	9.35	7.37	16	11.2	11.0	12.2	12.3	172

When they did that they never bothered to put proper landing gear down for the dirigibles. It was a bad day out, weatherwise, then it would be very difficult to land a dirigible without the proper landing gear. The dirigible is over @NUM1 feet long, without a very large landing service, it would be dangerous for the people in the dirigible, the people on the ground, and the people helping land the dirigible.	1	2		2																						100	5	112	6	0	0	4.62	20.0	24	10	10	6	1	12	63	10.3	8.76	6.37	10	9.9	10.0	12.0	11.2	146
10288	16238	6	the Empire State building faced many problems.To dock a dirigible, It needed a good/safe dock site. Also, the wind so high up would make it nearly impossible for a dirigible to stay docked. Finally, the dirigible would be very hazardous to the people below because It was extremely Flammable.	2	2		2																						49	4	59	3	0	0	4.88	12.5	10	5	8	8	0	8	26	10.2	10.38	7.67	6	9.6	8.15	10.5	11.9	77
10297	16247	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The major obstacle to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. To allow dirigibles to anchor at empire state building for several hours a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire buildings flat roof, so rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. Once architects had designed the mooring mast it could be complete and useful. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building.	2	2		2																						151	7	160	2	0	0	4.880794701986755	21.571428571428573	50	18	13	5	2	8	75	12.3	10.68	7.53	20	10.5	10.76	15.25	12.0	230

This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building"" (lines @NUM1).

If a dirigible was held by a single cable, this would add stress to the building's frame.

""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, line @NUM2) The wind would cause the dirigible to sway and not be very stable.

10314	16264	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some minor obstacles were the frame and strength of the building. Other obstacles were major such as nature which cannot be controlled. In paragraph nine the author explains that if a thousand-foot dirigibles were to be moored to the top of the Empire State Building it would add stress to the building's frame. Also with wind pressure the building's foundation would be affected. In order to allow dirigibles to dock, the frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. As nature as a great affect on the use of the mooring mast it would be almost impossible for dirigibles to be tethered onto the building. The wind would send the dirigibles swiveling around the mooring mast as the author describes in paragraph fourteen.      Other obstacles the builders faced were most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, most landing fields weighed down the back of the blimps would lead weight (which wouldn't be safe to have dangling over pedestrians), the last problem was there was an existing law againts airships flying low over urban areas.

One of these obstacles being stress. Yes, stress. This is because when you have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building, only by which is held by a single cable tether, it adds stress to the frame of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. Seeing as most dirigibles have been known to use hydrogen rather than helium, you would think hydrogen is the one to go with. Unfortunately, hydrogen is a fire caution because it is extremely flamable. So safety was definitely another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. A final obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is simply because the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, on repeat because violent currents would constantly shifting the winds on the top of the building. There would be no solution, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, in the informative excerpt, The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon Lüsted.	3	4		4																						223	12	250	13	0	0	4.901345291479821	18.583333333333332	70	25	8	12	1	21	122	11.8	10.44	7.26	31	10.0	10.63	12.4	12.4	339

If a dirigible was to catch on fire, then the whole Empire State Building would be destroyed, including everyone in it. It also wasn't safe because strong, violent winds could blow and detach the dirigible, causing danger to pedestrians below.

The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't use helium, they use hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire it would cause a threat to New York City which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another problem was winds. Winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" Was attempting to reach the mooring mast. The captain couldn't get anywhere near the mast.

10421	16371	6	Creating a mooring mast to sit atop the Empire State Building that would function and allow dirigibles to dock there was an incredibly challenging task for those who built the Empire State Building. Because the building was not originally designed to support the extra weight and size of a mooring mast, architects had to work to redesign the frame of the whole building. The architects modified plans to strengthen the steel frame of the building enough so that it could handle the added stress of a mooring mast. While builders were able to fix this problem, many obstacles remained that could not be avoided. One of these was the danger of attempting to control a dirigible. Dirigibles were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen which would threaten the safety of the citizens of highly populated New York City. Also, dirigibles were traditionally weighed down with lead while docked to keep the blimb from floating around in the wind. This could not be done on the Empire State Building because it would mean lead bricks would be dangling over pedestrians constantly. Besides all these practical obstacles, it was against the law for aircrafts to fly over urban areas, and that was the final obstacle that kept the mooring mast from being used.	3	4		4																						211	9	225	5	0	0	4.957345971563981	23.444444444444443	54	33	11	10	3	14	113	13.7	11.38	8.54	38	11.2	12.96	14.75	12.3	308

If a plan is not completely safe, it shouldn't happen. The Empire State Building would not have been stable enough with the winds being so powerful. Also, most dirigibles or blimps used hydrogen not helium which would be extremely dangerous if the blimp caught on fire. Especially in a place as crowded as New York.

10453	16403	6	In building the Empire State Building, builders had to deal with numerous obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was what the dirigibles would attach to. Builders thought that by adding a mooring mast it would make docking easy, although they disregarded the building's foundation. The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly. The dirigibles clearly went against this law and the idea for using the mast for docking. After failed attempts at docking the idea went away, and builders realized the plan would never work.	2	3		3																						151	9	169	6	0	0	5.2781456953642385	16.77777777777778	39	29	7	9	4	16	79	11.8	12.41	7.92	27	8.7	10.43	10.833333333333334	12.1	229

10534	16484	6	There was three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the densely populated area, the violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. First, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Since the dock would be above downtown New York, there is a higher risk of the dock blowing up due to the density. Secondly, nature was a great obstacle. There were many winds on top of the building and the wind currents were constantly changing violently, there was a gigantic fear of the dirigible swiveling around and hitting another building. Finally, the dock could never allow a ship to be tied up legally due to the existing law of airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigible would not be safe, and the entire idea will drop. For these reasons or obstacles, many builders of the Empire state building faced while attempting to allow blimps to dock there.	3	3		3																						173	8	192	11	0	0	4.895953757225434	21.625	48	23	14	15	6	19	89	12.5	10.5	8.54	32	10.5	12.11	13.0	12.8	256

The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air.

10590	16540	6	Architects constructing the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The idea of making a mast wasnt so farfetched at first. As construction neared completion many concerns arose. Many dirigibles outside the United States use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. Another problem was the docking of the blimps, winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast. Lastly a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes. When all the problems came together the idea of mooring dirigibles quietly disappeared.	3	2		3																						116	8	126	1	0	0	5.362068965517241	14.5	39	17	6	7	0	9	51	11.1	12.75	9.66	30	8.9	10.63	8.142857142857142	11.9	184
10593	16543	6	When the Empire State building was built they came accross some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. Some reasons are when the dirigibles were made they werent made to go high. So when the Empire State building went up the dirigible had a slight problem. Most dirigibles that are made out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. But, hydrogen is highly flameable.	1	1		1																						66	5	73	1	0	0	4.924242424242424	13.2	18	11	4	4	1	6	38	8.3	9.85	7.4	12	7.3	7.7	7.0	9.9	97
10594	16544	6	When builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple obstacles. The most important was the issue of safety because the dirigible would cause chaos if it caught on fire. Hydrogen would be too dangerous to use in the dirigible if it could catch fire at any moment.Another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent air currents, and these would shift the position of the dirigible if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast.The last issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height, for it was too close to an urban area. This made it illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were allowed to try before the idea was ruined. Neither could successfully dock, and the idea was finished.	4	3		3																						188	11	209	7	0	0	4.557894736842106	17.272727272727273	46	25	11	6	4	17	113	10.7	8.88	7.53	27	9.1	11.34	13.0	11.6	267
10595	16545	6	"Based on the excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there seems to be two main problems with the docking of dirigibles in New York City.

The Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, but the operator pulled away for fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. The second problem, though slightly easier to rectify was the law that prohibited any aircraft near the buildings of New York City. This basically made even attempting to dock in illegal. There are many reasons why the idea of zeppelins didn't get off the ground worldwide, and this excerpt about New York was a prime example of the obsticles that couldn't be safely tackled."	3	3		3																						145	7	164	7	0	0	4.8068965517241375	20.714285714285715	47	15	8	9	3	17	78	11.6	9.75	9.35	32	9.0	12.69	12.4	12.0	210
10597	16547	6	"Based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames. The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the Fire @CAPS1 the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. With those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely. After realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built."	3	3		3																						165	9	186	8	0	0	5.042424242424242	18.333333333333332	45	18	14	12	2	20	83	11.5	11.2	9.14	36	9.2	11.93	12.2	12.5	254
10601	16551	6	The dream for the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock On the top of it. It sounded like a great idea but the builders faced many obstacles trying to reach the goal of having them dock there. The first problem they faced was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation so it wouldn't stress the building's frame. To do this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with a illuminated inside. The building was now 102 floors. Even though all the hard work the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles wer highly flamable, after one caught on fire in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building didn't want the same to happy in the highly populated New York City. Also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off. Also there was a law that stated the air craft's can't fly to low to urban areas. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible was never achieved.	4	4		4																						224	12	243	1	0	0	4.59375	18.666666666666668	59	30	15	11	4	14	134	9.5	8.88	7.52	29	8.2	9.62	8.5	10.1	312
10614	16564	6	Although constructing a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, a number of obstacles prevented this theory from becoming reality. The builders and architects had to change the frame of the building completely to accommodate the weight of the mast, and this costed over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen over helium, which was very flammable, and if a dirigible suffered the same fate as the Hindenburg, it would cause a much greater accident at ground level. The greatest challenge that the mast faced was constanly shifting winds from violent air currents. This caused the back of the ship swivel around the mast, even when tied to it, which caused a problem. Most importantly there was already an existing law that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up to it. Although the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, this feat couldn't be accomplished due to the obstacles.	4	4		4																						190	7	208	10	0	0	4.9	27.142857142857142	52	25	12	10	3	17	105	15.2	10.86	8.89	36	12.7	15.05	16.75	14.3	282

10625	16575	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had planned for it to be the tallest building in existance, but they were thwarted by the engineer of the Chrysler Building. They put a new top onto the building, making it forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men, Al Smith decided to add a crown of his own to the building. He built a mooring at the 102nd floor that would accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building. The also needed to finds safe ways to dock the blimps. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch. Balloons were powered by flammable gases too, a safety hazard in a big city. Plus, weights could not be hanging over city streets in order to way down the ship. These problems made the dirigible popularity drop quite alot, so the mooring was never used to its full potential.	3	2		3																						189	12	209	6	0	0	4.603174603174603	15.75	52	27	16	3	4	17	103	8.1	8.52	8.35	28	7.1	8.86	8.666666666666666	9.3	259
10631	16581	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles and they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the overall safety. Dirigibles that were built outside the U. S required the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas that poses great danger. An example of this was when the Hindenburg was destroyed on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. It finally occurred, that if a dirigible was destroyed over a densely populated area, it could potentially hurt a lot more people. A second obstacle that builders had to face was nature itself. At that altitude, there were violent air currents causing winds to constantly shift. This was a danger to the landing of dirigibles too. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would keep swaying. It would be harder to dock passengers, and allow for inspections. Also, dirigibles would typically weighted down with lead weights. However, because it was so high up, this was not practical or safe. The last obstacle these builders had to face were laws. One specific law did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. It was also illegal for the airship to tie up or even aproach the building. Overall, these obstacles denied the potential of the mooring mast.	3	4		4																						219	17	247	11	0	0	4.840182648401827	12.882352941176471	56	30	18	16	4	30	114	7.5	9.15	8.42	45	6.9	8.9	7.125	10.6	332

Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas.

5989	9545	4	The author decided to finish the story with that phrase to show that she will wait for her next year and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and prove that she can do it one more time and that she is used to live there now.	0	0		0																						63	3	66	0	0	0	3.6666666666666665	21.0	5	12	2	6	4	2	51	6.4	3.72	1.79	2	5.6	9.03	10.833333333333334	6.4	70
5991	9547	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will try the test again and get a fresh new start.  Also I think that its showing the reader if you fail something the first time don’t be afraid to go back and try it again. I also think that the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the test in the winter and doesn’t like what shes in. But in the spring when the hibiscus has buds on it shes going to have a fresh start on the test and the flower will have a new environment to survive in.	1	2		2																						102	4	109	0	0	0	4.038834951456311	25.75	19	19	6	6	5	7	65	14.7	6.69	7.49	7	11.8	14.78	13.5	9.7	127
5995	9551	4	This last paragraph reveals something special to the reader. Saeng was given new hope winter mothers understanding and the hibiscus plant. She felt hopeless, miserable and incomparable upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland. When she came home, however, seeing the roots of the plant buried in the ground gave her new determination. The flower represents her. It adapted to be able to survive in cold weather, or hard times, in Saeng's case. The roots are her past and although they are buried, they are not forgotten. The actual flower represents a new life for Saeng in a new country .The author, Minfong Ho, gave personification or human–izing to non-living things to the story. This is why the author used the last paragraph then why she did.	3	2		3																						130	10	150	8	0	0	4.9	13.0	35	18	17	3	5	23	65	8.9	9.68	7.63	20	7.7	8.53	6.75	10.5	193
6004	9560	4	Why the author concluds the story with ths paragraph because its telling the seasons and how they change and how they come and go and they start of with a new season then its something different. An I think thats why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus cause after spring is winter & when it was spring they have all the nice beautiful flower thats smell good. An when spring gone its winter so all the plants had died out they not going to be the same how they used to be.	1	1		1																						95	3	100	0	0	0	4.147368421052631	31.666666666666668	18	15	6	1	5	5	60	14.0	7.38	6.7	4	10.8	12.95	16.833333333333332	8.8	117
6011	9567	4	The author ended the story with that specific quote because it shows the grasp in understanding the beauty & marvels of nature. Saeng spent a lot of money to buy a distinct flower called dok faeng-nol. Saeng was taking a driver's test a liscence but was failing it, and during her test she found that plant. Ashamed that she failed the test, she still showed her mother the flower she found, which was not like the one at home. Her mother is pleased with the flowers and understands that Saeng failed her test. Her mother said about the flower, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That what matters that was a figurative speech that there's hope for Saeng to pass her test again when she her learned more refined and is ready to try again. And with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring signifies a fresh new start at success.	2	3		3																						171	8	189	6	0	0	4.47953216374269	21.375	45	25	12	10	8	19	91	10.4	8.24	7.94	18	8.1	9.93	7.833333333333334	8.1	216
6013	9569	4	It is actually a very powerful last statement, Even though she failed her driver’s test, she has realized that she will just have to keep being strong and be patient. Soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt, and she will “return” to take her test and will  be determined to pass. Saeng  bought the hibiscus to feel as if she were back in Vietnam, and felt as if it could fill that place in her heart were she misses it. “I paid nineteen dollars for  it”. She  says it like she was disappointed  in failing the  test but also that saying which is free back in vietnam was so expensive in the united states. A hibiscus flower is tropical so when it blooms in the spring will be when she becomes ready to give the test a second try.	3	2		3																						143	6	158	4	0	0	4.026845637583893	24.833333333333332	23	22	9	11	6	15	90	12.4	6.98	7.26	15	10.9	13.4	14.0	10.8	185
6029	9585	4	The author concludes with this ending because it because it gives hope. It is like a happy ending to a sad story. It is also her final thought for the story and a good end point.	1	1		1																						36	3	39	0	0	0	3.9722222222222223	12.0	9	2	4	1	1	3	20	3.3	4.39	5.55	2	4.4	4.8	5.0	3.1	47
6033	9589	4	The author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show that she will try again with a new start. When she see’s the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus. The hibiscus brings back memories of her childhood. She then takes it home and shows the plant to her mother. Her mother replies with a “You what?” hearing her daughter tell her how much it is. With the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope. By saying she will start once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she means she will try again with a new and frash start.	2	1		2																						136	7	148	6	0	1	4.411764705882353	19.428571428571427	29	24	5	9	5	18	79	9.1	7.72	7.04	10	6.1	8.64	10.8	8.4	168
6038	9594	4	The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage.	3	3		3																						233	22	269	6	1	16	4.274261603375527	10.772727272727273	62	26	15	13	3	32	126	6.6	6.78	6.98	27	6.5	7.3	6.571428571428571	8.3	309
6043	9599	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows saeng being mature about it and being confident knowing she can take it again. When it says “ saeng vowed silently to herself she thought about everything and the phrase is almost like she is going to start over.	1	1		1																						50	2	52	0	0	0	4.62	25.0	7	9	2	3	2	4	31	12.8	9.58	8.35	6	9.5	10.8	13.5	0.0	67
6046	9602	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time.	1	1		1																						50	3	55	1	0	0	4.42	16.666666666666668	15	7	0	3	2	6	29	7.7	7.48	6.36	4	6.3	7.48	8.0	7.8	67
6051	9607	4	The author concludes the story the way she does because it shows that Saeng   needs to heal from the failing of the test before she can take it again. Saeng already knows that she  can heal. She realizes that she has gotten used to where she now lives, that things in her new land, like the sound of geese, are now “familiar to her”. The narrator of the story says, “..she  realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” Things in Saeng new home had been strange to her at first, but she had healed and gotten used to them. Saeng has also healed from leaving her original home of Vietnam. She was sad to leave her home, “ A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.”, but she had healed. Saeng  remembers the flowers that she had known in vietnam as “old friends”, showing that it did not hurt her to remember them. When Saeng heals from failing   her driving test, like she had healed when moving  from Vietnam to the united states, she can re-visit the test, without pain.	3	3		3																						201	8	230	11	0	0	4.197115384615385	26.0	40	39	9	12	4	28	119	11.4	7.26	6.85	13	9.5	11.23	13.75	9.2	253
6053	9609	4	when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. That is in there for many reasons. One is because when winter comes and brings all the snow it kills her garden. So thats why she wants it to be spring again so she can start growing things agian in her garden. She got to take a test on the things that she is growing to make sure it is @CAPS1 for someone to eat it. Thats why I think the paragraph “when the come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”	0	0		0																						136	7	150	7	0	0	4.110294117647059	19.428571428571427	27	21	4	11	5	12	87	9.3	6.27	6.62	7	7.4	9.37	10.2	6.4	158
6063	9619	4	The auther concludes the story with this statement because it shows that to her the hibiscus symbolizes overcoming obstacles. It symbolizes this because she says”...and the geese return and this is budding, I will take that test again” (Ho @NUM1). This shows that even though she failed it this time when the hibiscus gets bigger she will retake the test, it shows ??? or overcoming obstacles. Also I believe that this symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it “gives her strength from her old country”. This shows that it symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it will help her overcome this test. It will do this by giving her strength or comforting her. From this you can tell that the author ends the story with this statement. ???...	2	2		2																						124	7	141	2	0	6	4.975806451612903	17.714285714285715	24	27	3	2	4	15	71	11.1	10.61	6.96	11	7.7	8.6	12.8	11.5	174
6064	9620	4	I believe that the author concludes  the story with this paragraph because it says that Saeng is confident and is willing to go back and take the test. Saeng feels good about her self and wants to do this.	1	1		1																						39	2	42	0	0	0	4.175	20.0	7	8	3	1	3	4	24	8.4	7.14	7.44	3	7.4	8.83	10.25	0.0	49
6068	9624	4	The author concludes the story with when they come back …”to show how saeng has changed throughout the plot of the story. In the beginning she refers to her new home as, “walking into another world.” As teenager she had to move from Vietnam where traditions are so much different than in the United States. However, there is one plant that is similar, the winter Hibiscus. The plant connects her previous life and home to the life and home she lives now. It was hard to adapt to the situation of moving, but the plant created familiar scents and the “familiar fragrance “which “filled her lungs .” It was even difficult for saeng to say the words “at home” without bursting into tears. Once the winter Hibiscus was in the ground it changed saeng and she realized that she needed to appreciate what she had. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it showed how much the plant resembled saeng and how her mind set on life was altered.	3	2		3																						173	8	186	5	0	0	4.545977011494253	21.75	44	27	9	7	6	23	98	12.4	9.06	8.06	24	10.6	12.65	12.2	12.3	237
6076	9632	4	I the narrator this paragraph in the story because hibiscus is a valueable plant and garden is you own decision if you like to grow things like her mother grow hot pepper.

6082	9638	4	The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to, a place where she didn’t like and knew No one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what don’t give up, have faith. At the end Saeng has faith in herself that she can past the test next time. She @MONTH1 have realized that just because your at place you don’t want to, it doesn’t mean you can’t go on.	1	2		2																						84	5	92	3	0	0	4.023809523809524	16.8	14	20	1	4	1	13	54	5.9	5.16	6.54	4	5.1	7.2	7.6	5.7	99
6096	9652	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because to tell us that she will try and find that flower to bring back memories of her old home. To show us that they will be caming   back again it will survive even though its not from where she wanted it to be from. In the story it says,” I I failed the test,” meaning saeng had bought the hibiscus that wasn it real or what she thought was not what she wanted to be. In the last paragraph she says she will take that test again. Saying she will find winter hibiscus that is how it use to be in the homeland. She’s hoping they survive and hoping she finds a flower like it because in that last paragraph it says ,”saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again,” meaning she hopes and prays she will find one like her old homeland.	0	0		0																						172	7	183	7	0	0	4.161849710982659	24.714285714285715	26	33	5	7	6	16	108	12.5	7.09	7.17	13	9.8	11.95	10.4	7.8	211

She then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother who she left behind so now she is connected to the plant. Also she sees geese fly over head heading south for the winter, so she says “When they come back,” so she means when the geese fly north for @DATE1. And when “the snow melts"" so when it becomes warmer and starts spring. When “this hibiscus is budding,” so when spring comes and the plant starts to bloom she will “take that test again"" so she says she will take the driving test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test . She vows to herself that come spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass."	2	2		2																						186	11	200	5	0	0	4.165775401069519	17.0	31	39	7	16	7	22	107	8.7	6.56	6.96	11	6.6	8.67	10.6	6.9	218
6106	9662	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author did this so that people who read the story will know what she is gonna do next spring and they might make out another storie in so that you will know that she will take the test in the spring.	1	1		1																						52	2	55	0	0	0	4.076923076923077	26.0	10	10	1	0	1	2	36	10.8	6.45	6.14	3	8.7	10.4	13.5	0.0	62
6113	9669	4	In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does	3	3		3																						269	14	288	9	0	0	4.390334572490707	19.214285714285715	66	39	19	18	5	32	150	18.5	8.25	8.18	22	14.7	16.55	13.5	10.9	346
6115	9671	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph -“ when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” (@NUM1) because she feels that when the hibiscus blooms she can too bloom by passing the test. Also Saeng is relating herself to the hibiscus. “Its’ flower arn’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it throu in here, this winter hibiscus.” (@NUM1) Her mother is trying to tell her she can be strong also. She too can make it through the cold months. “like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etered against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.” (@NUM1) Just like the geese Saeng is realizing to be proud of herself and there will be other chances. Don’t always doubt yourself becase they will be other chances. Don’t be afraid to try again.	2	2		2																						165	9	185	7	0	0	4.569696969696969	18.333333333333332	36	21	11	15	5	26	94	16.6	8.89	8.24	14	12.6	14.17	18.333333333333332	9.9	210
6116	9672	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home.	1	1		1																						79	3	82	0	0	0	4.1265822784810124	26.333333333333332	13	13	2	3	0	3	54	11.2	6.74	6.54	4	8.8	10.52	13.166666666666666	3.1	96
6118	9675	4	The reason why the author wrote the conclusion paragraph was to show that Saeng is looking forward to a brighter future. Saeng is hoping to see the geese once more that remind her of her homeland and that see wants to pass the driving. In this story I feel as though Saeng is a very sentimental person and so that is why I think that is reason the author wrote the conclusion paragraph.	1	1		1																						73	3	76	0	0	0	4.301369863013699	24.333333333333332	16	12	3	5	2	4	44	11.0	7.72	7.22	8	9.2	10.82	13.166666666666666	8.8	95
6130	9687	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they wanted to show that she is comited to her nature especially to The hibiscus. She thought that the hibiscus was special because of what she did with it. Like when they said “she reached out and touched petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velet toward the centre”. And that’s why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																						77	5	82	1	0	0	4.558441558441558	15.4	12	12	4	2	3	10	45	7.7	8.41	7.48	10	5.8	7.72	7.699999999999999	8.8	103

6143	9700	4	The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today.	2	2		2																						167	9	178	2	0	0	4.832335329341317	18.555555555555557	49	23	3	3	6	15	94	10.6	10.27	7.96	27	9.4	11.99	13.2	12.8	255

From that known she throught she was going to give up.

6151	9708	4	By adding this paragraph to the end of the story, it show that a resolution was made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heartbroken however, after buying the hibiscus, she had found hope and motivation and decides, in the end, that she will take the test again, “in the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. Its to help move the story to a conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this. Readers are able to abtein the message as the story from paragraphs like this. In this case, the author’s message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things. It is important to know what a author is trying to tell the reader through paragraphs as not only a reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express their ideas clearly to an audience.	2	2		2																						193	7	211	11	0	0	4.409326424870466	27.571428571428573	46	26	10	7	8	21	115	11.4	8.01	7.45	22	10.3	11.71	19.666666666666668	11.0	263
6154	9711	4	The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, “… and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home.	2	2		2																						124	7	136	2	0	0	4.216	17.857142857142858	24	24	6	10	6	13	75	7.4	6.44	6.55	7	6.7	8.05	8.833333333333334	10.0	155

The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said,""It's strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that’s what matters. the author is say ultimately that tough times are irevitable, so hold on to the moments that make you smile, for they will help you perservere through the times that are tough."	3	2		3																						94	5	108	8	0	0	4.819148936170213	18.8	22	17	6	5	1	17	52	16.9	10.17	9.05	14	13.1	14.65	18.0	11.9	127
6170	9727	4	The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.	3	3		3																						239	14	268	15	0	4	4.425	17.142857142857142	58	30	17	13	9	33	139	9.4	7.72	6.87	20	7.5	8.8	7.833333333333334	8.3	299
6186	9743	4	Then author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sums up how the memories and the plant effects her. Just like the plant Saeng grows better in her own country and likes it better there but she can still survive in a new place if it is taken care of and fights to stay beautiful. The ending shows that Saeng realizes that if she trys harder she can survive like the plant, so she is going to take the test agian. Her mother say, “I‘ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” Her mother is trying to tell the daughter its ok and she get through the hard times. In the end Saeng knows she can.	2	3		3																						134	8	143	3	0	0	4.223880597014926	16.75	27	25	6	11	6	14	74	9.6	7.09	7.81	10	7.3	9.52	10.6	7.2	162

So when the country that she is has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring. Which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test. Thats why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay.	2	1		2																						128	6	141	7	0	0	4.1640625	21.333333333333332	27	20	5	7	3	18	81	14.2	6.8	7.2	10	11.1	14.05	27.5	9.5	157

It has helped he get threw some rough and difficult times. In the story Saeng has just failed her @CAPS1 test and had to walk home. She was very upset. On her way home Saeng saw a familiar flower. She had walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen. The employee pointed her towards the flower. The hibiscus brought back many memories at her hometown in vietnam.

6213	9770	4	The reason why the author of the story ended the story like that is because after all the hard time that plant went through, it will still bad at the end of the winter.

6217	9774	4	Explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Cause it all make a little cent to concludes the story with this. Here why I think it does. The paragraph in the one of the main pieces to to the story. “In the spring, when the snows melt and after return,” all she say is is when the snow is gone and the grass come back, I will start planting again and she would be happy with it, “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again,” she went to put her plants up again and tests them to see how them over so she can do them even again. Saeng loved this plant so much that she can’t wait. But when it does she is going to plant a lot. That what the paragraph is saying Saeng is going to wait so he can plant a hibiscus. However, since she came to United States she loved the flower that very much.	0	0		0																						164	11	178	7	0	0	3.9939024390243905	14.909090909090908	26	31	3	14	5	20	110	7.6	5.34	6.1	7	6.6	8.44	12.75	6.6	191
6223	9780	4	"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" for a couple of reasons. Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she doesn’t want to be, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope."	2	2		2																						129	6	145	9	0	0	4.51937984496124	21.5	32	17	7	9	5	21	76	10.7	8.36	7.28	14	8.1	9.77	13.75	9.3	167
6235	9792	4	The author decides to conclude the story with that because she wants the moral of the story to be burnt in your head. She believes that you will always have a chance to try again and the flower restarts its cycle and it gets another chance to bud and that symbolizes that you can start over and try again just like the girl is going to do on the test. She is doing the test again when the starts over so she can do. it with the flower and the flower budding will support her and give her hope.	2	2		2																						99	4	103	0	0	0	3.98989898989899	24.75	14	21	1	5	6	4	67	13.9	6.22	7.51	8	11.4	13.6	17.166666666666668	7.8	119
6236	9793	4	I believe that the author ends the story the way she did because it talk’s about both of the subjects. The author is trying to say that when she takes her driving test next spring the hibiscus will give her confidence to pass her driving test.

6239	9796	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she needs to adapt to the new country. She wants to wait when the hibiscus is budding. The plant budding shows than it is adapting to a new environment just like Saeng. The story shows that Saeng is not used to the new country. she cries when she sees the plants because it reminds her of her old home. The plant also comforts her. when she addapts to the new country, then she will take the test again.	1	2		2																						89	7	97	1	0	0	4.258426966292135	12.714285714285714	17	17	5	4	0	9	52	7.5	6.61	7.36	9	5.5	8.02	8.3	6.7	110
6253	9810	4	I think Saeng concluded with this story because there is always time to make up for the past if the past allows you to meaning that @CAPS1 didn’t past the test. I fell she met that “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to me this means that even though it is snowing outside there is always next spring to start growing back up the vegetable garden this also relates to Saeng even though she failed the test there is always another change we can make up for that lost and retry and try to succeed at this one.	1	1		1																						115	2	119	3	0	0	4.165217391304348	57.5	21	24	3	9	4	9	73	27.0	7.45	8.69	10	21.0	23.7	26.5	0.0	140
6260	9817	4	When they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author’s main porpuse of this lines wa to grab the readers attention by making a continuing paragraph that a closing she’s adapting to circumstances. Saeng values the uniqueness of plants, she is also conforted by memories of her homeland	1	1		1																						72	3	79	5	0	0	4.791666666666667	24.0	18	11	4	6	2	12	38	13.1	10.22	9.87	15	10.3	12.38	14.0	11.2	100
6261	9818	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to conclude that she will wait a little bit of time, until plants can be be planty so if she fails again, she will have something to hold on to. For example, when Saeng “failed the @NUM1) she try to overcome the feeling of failing, by buying something that reminds her of her country and bring back the memories to past thro this time. Another example is when Saeng “felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral (@NUM2),she forgot about everything that was happening in her life, from moving to @LOCATION1 to failing her test this feeling concentratted her on feeling like home again. In conclusion, the author conclusion, creates the belief that that the was Saeng gets over her problems is by remembering memories like the plant, that reminded her of her home country.	2	2		2																						178	4	197	15	0	0	4.702247191011236	44.5	41	28	6	9	3	25	100	23.0	10.06	9.04	26	18.3	20.27	26.5	14.6	244
6263	9820	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith for a new start. Saeng compares herself to the hibiscus. When the, “hibiscus is @NUM1), she will retake the test. This shows that when the hibiscus restarts its life, so will she. Saeng feels that when the hibiscus is “strong enough to make it through the cold @NUM2), then she is strong enough to pass her driver’s test and live in a new country. Winter and cold represent death, and spring represent a new life or beginning. Saeng thinks to herself, “in the spring… I will take the test @NUM3). This is a new beginning for Saeng, a new hope.	2	3		3																						112	8	131	7	0	0	4.477876106194691	14.125	29	15	11	3	4	21	61	6.8	7.18	6.45	6	4.0	6.31	7.0	8.5	138
6272	9829	4	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a sentence about retaking the drivers test in the spring, to express the themes of adopting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower “Madagascar penwinhle” she thinks “how strange to see it in a pot” because “Back home it just grows wild,” The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says “and the geese return,” because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says “I will take that test again.” This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver’s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that “the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she “Dug out a hole” and knows it’s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng’s character.	3	3		3																						253	12	275	14	0	0	4.818181818181818	21.083333333333332	62	37	23	14	8	43	135	13.9	10.33	8.32	40	10.8	12.97	14.5	12.0	355

6279	9836	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because during winter everything dies down till springs where everything is lively again, the Saeng would feel more motivated to do well on the test. Saeng is sort of like the plant, strives and worries in the winter and then blooms beautifully in the spring.  Also, I think the memories that the winter hibiscus plant brought her; motivated  her to stop staying in the past and move on towards the future.	2	1		2																						79	3	88	3	0	0	4.691358024691358	27.0	19	11	2	8	3	9	45	20.8	10.57	8.19	9	16.3	17.83	15.5	0.0	113

6286	9843	4	The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng‘s attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she’s not going to give up. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. In conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons.	2	2		2																						117	6	125	2	0	0	4.3247863247863245	19.5	30	15	7	4	3	10	70	8.7	7.43	6.49	10	7.4	9.17	11.2	8.8	157
6287	9844	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph I think because since the girl failed her test the bud reminds her of her grandmothers long grey hair and I guess that gives her good luck so when the winter passes by and the spring time hits thats buds start to come back out and thats when she will take her test again.

When the Hibiscus is budding it has a new life. When all this happens Saeng will have a new fresh start too. Leaving the story to end like this is a cliff-hanger for some. It makes you wanting more, knowing she failed her test you want to know if Saeng will pass it in the spring, @CAPS1 a fresh new start. Everything and everyone will have new starts when the beginning of the new season comes around when the hibiscus blooms it will be like she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, new connections w/her past and comfort during hard times.

When Saeng fails her driving test she is disappointed. After failing her test she went too greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland. Then where sh bought the hibiscus. It reminded her of how things were different. And how thing change when you go to different place. Sometimes they aren't so pleasant at first but you get use to them. Like when she first saw the geese flying in a ""V"". she though of how strange it was. But now it is farmiliar to her. After failing her driving test Saeng learns that even though things nav change she needs to be able to try again."	2	2		2																						135	12	149	0	0	0	4.340740740740741	11.25	24	21	8	10	4	13	84	5.8	6.72	6.65	11	3.8	6.59	5.875	7.6	168
6311	9868	4	The author concludes this story because it shows her determination. It says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home. It also says that as the buds grow so will she. But her more mentally then physically. And her taking the test again is meaning that she has faith in herself that she will mature and grow up to be a person who misses their home land but accepts the new home that they live in. That is why the author ended this way.	2	2		2																						95	6	101	0	0	0	4.157894736842105	15.833333333333334	15	18	2	7	4	6	60	6.1	6.15	6.75	11	5.9	8.43	7.75	8.3	123

She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive ""V"" was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. Reflecting back I feel Saeng felt that the geese was secretly letting her know what she was doing was right."	1	1		1																						113	4	128	5	0	0	4.513274336283186	28.25	23	22	5	7	5	15	63	13.9	8.42	8.11	15	10.8	12.74	13.5	9.5	146
6326	9883	4	The author includes this paragraph into the story because the girl started giving up on herself and felt sad from moving to the United States and also from failing her drivers test, but lastly about the plant that she bought that wasn’t real. Also because he wanted to show that her self esteem had gone up and that she was more confident and wasn’t gonna give up on herself.	1	1		1																						69	2	73	1	0	0	4.449275362318841	34.5	13	12	3	5	5	4	42	16.8	8.89	8.09	9	14.4	14.38	17.75	0.0	94

6334	9891	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know that how Saeng @CAPS1 about the hibiscus. I thinks the author concludes this because he his telling the reader that the hibiscus gives saeng goodluck and with this good luck She will past the test. In the story it tells us how much saeng adores the plant For example when she got to the hibiscus She reached out and toched a petal gently. It Felt smooth and cool. Thats why the author use thal paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng @CAPS1 and how it make her  feel confident.	1	1		1																						107	5	114	0	0	0	4.324074074074074	21.6	26	19	6	1	4	10	58	9.8	7.6	7.8	10	8.1	10.06	11.0	9.4	137
6342	9899	4	I believe the author chooses to end the story wit this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represent her home. But she realizes  by the sight of the geese, flying sooth that evenyone has to leave home at some point. She has now come to terms with what is happening and she will try again for her drivers liscence soon. When the hibiscus buds again it will by symbolic to her and that is when she will be ready to try once again.	1	2		2																						84	5	91	1	0	0	4.235294117647059	17.0	17	13	3	6	3	9	51	7.1	6.78	7.48	13	6.3	9.58	8.6	9.4	108
6346	9903	4	I think that this snows hope because she had really missed her homeland and kind of found peace and serenity by being around them she says “That at least she could hold on to” meaning the bud I think that she was very upset because of missing home she missed having her grandmother wash her hair and put a dok mallk into it. I think that since she really had nothing else but the flowers that reminded of her homeland the text said “where was the fine toothed come the hibiscus hedge, the well. her gentle grandmother she was missing all these thing so I think that by putting her in this posistion it has brought her to a place of where she not only misses the people from her homeland but the beautiful things as well and how she always has kind of a part of home with her because of the flower.	2	2		2																						154	3	158	1	0	0	4.181818181818182	51.333333333333336	25	25	6	13	6	9	99	36.8	8.03	9.3	10	29.8	31.84	28.5	0.0	194
6349	9906	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author does this for several reasons. The author wants to show you that Saeng still has hope and that she believes she can make it right. Also, to show Saeng will still try and adapt to her surrounding and make friends. Saeng is also, determined that she will pass the test next time she takes it. Last it is emphazing the conflict and how Saeng overcame it.	2	1		2																						108	6	119	6	0	0	4.453703703703703	18.0	21	22	4	7	6	13	67	10.3	7.89	7.49	12	8.2	10.12	10.8	8.8	135
6353	9910	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to end on a happy yet motivating note. In the story Saeng says that she failed the test and was very dissapointed with herself. The test must have of been very important to her for her to be so dissapointed. The author also probably ended with this paragraph to show that Saeng is devoted in passing this test. Saeng seems like a sentemental yet reliable person. I believe that the test is to spend a minimal amount of money and she wants to earn respect from her mom. That is why taking and passing the test seems so important to Saeng. That is why the author ended with that paragraph.	1	1		1																						118	8	126	0	0	0	4.415254237288136	14.75	23	18	8	7	4	10	71	6.8	7.36	6.78	12	6.7	8.29	7.428571428571429	9.5	165

6364	9921	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is talking about how there will be a new start.

6367	9924	4	The author conclud the story with that because as winter come every thing goes away. Like the trees lose the leaves the geese fly south and the flower die off.

6371	9928	4	"The author includes the paragraph, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" to show that hibiscus is a symbol of time. Saeng uses the hibiscus to measure the amount of time there will be until she takes her test again.  The hibiscus also symbolizes the power to get through struggling (stay strong). Saeng had trouble with her test, but the hibiscus is there to help push her through it to prepare her for the next test. The hibiscus also helps Saeng's mother push through her hard time of seeing her daughter sad from not succeeding on the test. The plant helps the mother try and stay positive and it also helps the mother by trying to do the right thing for her daughter. In the story. the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to make her daughter happy. The hibiscus shows strong symbolism and it helps Saeng and her mother stay strong through out their struggles."	3	2		3																						162	9	182	3	0	0	4.52760736196319	18.11111111111111	39	31	9	8	5	17	93	11.6	8.71	6.54	13	8.8	10.47	11.4	10.3	215

6424	9981	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected.	3	2		3																						176	6	192	5	0	0	4.314917127071824	30.166666666666668	43	25	12	10	2	18	100	16.9	8.43	8.16	22	14.7	15.67	29.0	13.0	250

6434	9991	4	This sentence concludes the passage, to show how when the hibiscus is budding and a new season starts, Saeng will be a new person and will be able to take the test. In this sentence the cold snow, fleeing geese and planted hibiscus can all represent Saeng and what she is going through. They are either cold, ready to leave or restricted just like Saeng feels. But, when a new season starts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is no longer restricted in a pot, Saeng will also grow up and be able to take the test.

6436	9993	4	The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion.	1	1		1																						101	6	109	2	0	0	4.356435643564357	16.833333333333332	25	15	6	4	1	9	60	7.5	7.25	6.5	7	5.1	7.91	8.0	8.3	126
6438	9995	4	The author concludes the story with a paragraph taking the test again to show that the narrator @MONTH1 be upset about being in a new place but she will keep trying. The narrator gets upset when she knows the hibiscus is not like the one's from her old home. This upsets her because she probably misses things that she was used to before. The author uses that paragraph to show the narrator is strong and won’t give up on making things the way they were but also showing that she'll try to adapt to her new home. The author does this to show that you should keep trying at something that you love. The narrator will keep trying when the geese fly back and the hibiscus is budding. So the author is saying try if you fail and set goals to never give up.	2	2		2																						144	7	153	0	0	0	4.229166666666667	20.571428571428573	25	31	6	7	5	8	93	8.8	6.85	6.85	13	7.8	9.07	11.0	8.8	186
6442	9999	4	In the “passage winter Hibiscus” by monfong Ho, the quote “ when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again, it symbolizes @CAPS1 new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland @CAPS2 she states “I – failed the test.” This test meant more to then she just failing. She was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The “ when they came back…” quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again.	2	3		3																						141	6	154	7	0	0	4.323943661971831	23.666666666666668	35	21	8	12	5	24	75	13.2	7.67	7.95	18	10.7	13.27	14.0	11.2	184

The reason I think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland. It’s basically like she has a little peice of home in her new home. An example that represents this is, “Not like the kind we had before,” this is explaining the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this reminds her of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story the way they do,	2	1		2																						137	7	150	10	0	0	4.416058394160584	19.571428571428573	31	20	8	4	4	18	78	13.1	8.01	7.42	15	10.4	13.3	14.25	11.2	182

6472	10029	4	The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time.

6488	10045	4	With the hibiscus around Saeng she will have more courage and also have had more time to adapt in their new home. For Saeng the hibiscus is like motivation and it also reminds her.

The reason I think the author choose to end the story with the paticular comment is to show that Saeng had in the end found courage and is ready to accept her tasks in this foreign land.	0	0		0																						75	4	79	0	0	0	4.1866666666666665	18.75	18	11	7	2	3	6	44	7.7	6.67	6.88	7	7.1	9.12	10.375	8.8	94
6502	10059	4	"In the story “the Winter Hibiscus"", I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the memories  of  her old country would always be with her but she soon will adapt to her new one. Also from time to time she still will visit her old country. For example “when the show melts and the geese return"", The last sentences, then I will take the test again”, This sentence means that once she is adapted to this country on goes back to her old one she still will enjoy their either way."	1	1		1																						95	3	106	4	0	0	4.164948453608248	32.333333333333336	21	11	7	7	2	10	60	14.3	7.32	6.87	8	12.1	13.94	16.833333333333332	8.8	121
6509	10066	4	The author includes this last paragraph in the story, “Winter Hibiscus” to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to @LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng’s mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in @LOCATION2 that she is not used to. “When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.	3	3		3																						243	9	260	9	0	0	4.423868312757202	27.0	56	33	22	12	6	25	133	19.6	8.78	7.92	25	15.5	17.85	19.666666666666668	13.0	325

6522	10079	4	The author of ,”Winter Hibiscus ,” concludes the story with the paragraph,” When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again .”The author most likely chose this as the last paragraph to help the reader  understand  the message. The message of this story is no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. The author makes that the last paragraph to make the reader think and ponder upon what it means.	1	1		1																						102	4	113	8	0	0	4.490384615384615	26.0	19	20	4	10	6	13	59	17.1	9.35	7.34	9	14.1	13.88	17.666666666666668	8.8	137
6527	10084	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the true meaning of the hibiscus. The hibiscus is symbolic to Saeng in several ways, but the most important is that it represents change and growth and the ability to overcome obstacles. Upon seeing it, she is overcome with childhood memories and sentimentality. However, she must adjust to her new home if she wants to grow as a person. She will survive here, just as the hibiscus will survive through the winter. Also, Saeng vows that “in the spring” when “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is determined to succeed, and the hibiscus itself represents triumph over obstacles.  It stands for survival and endurance through life’s disappointments and challenges, from failing a driver’s test to starting a new life in a strange and foreign country. The author’s choice to end the story with this paragraph exhibits Saeng’s ultimate understanding of her strength through the symbol of the hibiscus.	3	3		3																						164	9	181	8	0	0	5.03030303030303	18.333333333333332	43	21	12	6	8	24	88	14.1	11.73	8.36	29	11.2	12.29	10.666666666666666	13.3	246
6528	10085	4	I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn’t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year. Ane example of this is an exact quote “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that.	1	1		1																						91	4	97	1	0	0	4.2967032967032965	22.75	20	15	4	2	2	8	55	10.2	7.49	7.02	8	8.6	10.44	12.375	8.8	118
6529	10086	4	The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her drivers test for the first time when the hibiscus starts to bud it will represent a change in her life. Also, Saeng use to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam so when the flower buds it could show that she has a new home.	1	1		1																						60	2	63	1	0	0	4.266666666666667	30.0	16	11	3	2	0	4	34	13.7	7.79	8.02	7	11.5	13.33	16.5	0.0	76
6533	10090	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the @CAPS1 word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels.	3	2		3																						168	7	181	7	0	0	4.880952380952381	24.0	47	28	5	5	8	28	82	22.6	11.27	9.95	25	17.3	18.7	15.75	14.2	233
6536	10093	4	The author ends the story this way because Saeng feels a sence of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother. According to the story “the familiar frogrence filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair.” you can also tell she misses her homeland but always keeps it close to her heart whereever she goes. The text states that, “it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” She seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits. When she failed the test she bought her “@CAPS1 Malik” flower, as a sence of comfort. They both decided to plant it in their garden and while doing so, Saeng received a huge boost of confidence to retake the test.	2	2		2																						150	8	161	5	0	0	4.6066666666666665	18.75	43	20	11	7	6	19	76	12.8	9.17	8.98	22	9.5	11.87	14.25	10.5	198
6539	10096	4	Because her school work was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a green garden. And it is obvious she failed the test so when spring starts to show she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom and she can do more study to pass the test and not have to take it again. I get the feeling though she is also looking forward to the spring time coming back now an day so she can enjoy the flowers and the presents of growing and studying.	1	1		1																						92	3	95	0	0	0	4.032608695652174	30.666666666666668	17	16	4	6	5	3	61	12.9	6.51	6.88	7	10.5	12.71	15.666666666666666	6.4	111

6561	10118	4	The author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over. She uses geese as a symbol for spring, when she would start preparing for this “test” once again. The hibiscus budding in this paragraph shows hope, because it is once again, a start of a cycle as well as an object of reminiscence in the story.

6564	10121	4	I believe the author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus”, written by Minfong Ho, with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, because she is trying to show how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test Saeng finds the Hibiscus, the memories of her home land and her grandmother consume her. She buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden. After she is done planting, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese fly overhead. Using her memory of her old home and her family, applied to her new surroundings, Saeng vows to re-take the test, to try again. The author ends the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up.	2	3		3																						149	6	169	12	0	0	4.644295302013423	24.833333333333332	42	28	7	6	6	24	79	12.8	9.23	7.83	19	10.6	11.26	14.25	10.9	205
6573	10130	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up until she successfully passes the task he mother gives her.Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant it is much to expensive. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much!” Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has failed her mother. Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. “Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.” This shows that even though she had failed she wasn’t going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home. It was very special to her.	1	1		1																						125	7	135	2	1	1	4.563492063492063	18.0	27	20	8	6	2	18	73	15.9	9.47	8.09	12	13.1	14.44	19.0	11.7	170

6596	10155	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for various reasons. For example, the whole passage is talking about how the hibiscus flower provides Saeng with the ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort her in a time of disappointment. This ending paragraph shows that “in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding,” and everything is beautiful again then Saeng will take her test again. She knows that with the help of the hibiscus plant, that she will pass the test. It shows that her hope and trust to pass the test comes from the hibiscus flower.

She meant that if the thing she likes the most overcomes its obstacle then she would do what hurted her the most over again. She doesn’t know if she takes the test over she would keep trying over and over until she passes it. In the story she doesn’t know to fit in. All she knows is what she learned in her country .

6652	10211	4	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again"" because its sympatizing Saeng ability to overcome her sorrow and give the test another chance.this is symbolised by when she says ""when the geese return and the hibiscus"" After fail of the test. She wasn't own considering retaking the test, but instead, just wished she could return to her old home and not how to think about it. But much like the geese returning in the spring, she says she will retake the test. She is like the geese because they overcome and adopt the cold harsh weather by flying elsewhere and returning when it's warm, like her she must wait until she is more ready and confident to take the test the second time around. The Hibiscus budding is symbolizing her strength and determination to pass the test the second time she takes it,because just like her the hibiscus survive the cold weather months, @CAPS1 bloom in the spring so must she last through the weather to pass in the spring. That is why the author consider the story with the paragraph to show that she hasn't given up and will take the test again, A sured that  to pass"	2	3		3																						233	6	261	11	0	0	4.568376068376068	39.0	46	37	14	12	12	24	143	19.6	9.24	7.59	20	14.9	17.41	29.5	13.0	312
6653	10212	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is waiting for a better time. It shows that she is has perserverance and will not give up on passing this test. She realizes that life comes and goes very quickly.

6660	10219	4	The Author includes this paragraph to this story in many reasons why. One reason why is because the story started off by saying and talking about Saeng failing her drivers test and being depressed over it. Then it gets into talking about the hibiscus and how it reminds her of homeland and all of the good memories that she has experienced. This all relates to this paragraph because Saeng will not return to the testing again until the thing that makes her happy and confident, the hibiscus starts to bud. That paragraph relates to every little bit of this story from the beginning to the end.	2	2		2																						106	5	112	1	0	0	4.613207547169812	21.2	21	16	6	2	5	7	64	10.9	9.17	7.82	17	9.2	9.99	11.0	9.4	150

The flowers in the greenhouse reminds her of where she grew up and her grandmother. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying. She tells her mom that she did not pass the test but in the last paragraph she vowed to herself that by spring she will. The author is giving us insight to Saeng's character. We now know that eventhough it is difficult for Saeng to let go of what she knows and love, she will have the strength to make it in a new world.?"	2	2		2																						135	8	150	1	0	1	4.229629629629629	16.875	29	23	5	4	5	14	84	8.1	6.62	7.52	13	6.1	8.91	7.833333333333334	8.0	163

6672	10231	4	I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because in the story, the author says “through the quiet repitition of season upon season” which means that seasons will come a seasons will go but she’ll always be there, ready to “take the test”	1	1		1																						45	1	47	2	0	0	4.733333333333333	45.0	11	7	3	3	1	8	24	23.3	10.81	7.97	4	18.5	19.78	24.5	0.0	63
6674	10233	4	The author concludes that failing the test is not the worst thing.

6700	10259	4	The author included this because she felt that since Saeng failed the test that maybe she should be given a second chance because she tried so hard before. When Saeng says “Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” It made her mom upset because she used alot of money for one plant just so she could feel at home again since she had one when she was at her old home. Eventually her mom say, “It’s a beautiful plant” to make her feel better because she feels bad for how she acted towards her daughter. After all the things Saeng had to go through is the reason the author added the the last passage into the story.	1	1		1																						119	5	125	1	0	0	4.2521008403361344	23.8	22	21	7	8	0	11	73	10.5	7.32	6.67	5	9.0	10.19	10.6	7.6	150
6711	10270	4	The author ends the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to show a comparison. Since the plant reminds her of home, when it buds she will be more confident to take the test. When she was looking at the petals of the flower it said, “Gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least she could hold on to.” This shows that she really missed her home, and she had nothing to give her confidence. The flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her drivers test. Saeng felt out of place in her new environment. The flower hibiscus, gave her motivation. It gave her a chance to connect with a part from her old home, in her new home. Saeng thinks, “And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar too”. This shows that this flower was a sentimental importance, she needed. Therefore, the author ended with that paragraph to show a comparison and the importance of the flower to her adapting.	3	3		3																						200	13	223	13	0	0	4.365	15.384615384615385	46	31	11	10	6	28	116	8.2	7.02	7.07	20	6.8	9.08	13.5	9.6	255

6732	10291	4	The author concludes the story with that like, to leave the reader guessing. The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve. The author was trying to show how she can change, and grow just like her plant.	2	2		2																						81	5	90	4	0	0	4.333333333333333	16.2	12	17	3	3	3	9	48	7.1	6.9	6.58	8	4.9	7.47	7.699999999999999	7.6	100
6734	10293	4	In winter hibiscus the teenager girl Saeng fails her driver’s test, and then runs into a winter hibiscus and comes in touch with her memories. The author concludes the story with re-trying the test when the geese return and hibiscus buds to show comfort & familiarity. When the speaker says “almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become” This example shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature and that was what was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for  the reader because it took her for winter to discover this, and winter is when its too late,  the geese have left and the flower has closed, so when spring comes they’ll be open to new opportunities and so will she with the familarity around her.	3	2		3																						148	4	160	4	0	0	4.453333333333333	37.5	37	24	8	7	8	16	84	18.3	9.18	8.47	14	15.3	17.44	15.0	13.4	204
6735	10294	4	I think she concluded with this statement because she doesn’t know if she will pass but she isn’t giving up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she feels bad and the plant helped to cheer her up so when she sees the plant next year she wants to take the test.The plant is like a sign of good luck.

6749	10308	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the “test” again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng’s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she “failed the test”, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow.	3	3		3																						147	6	157	4	0	0	4.673469387755102	24.5	33	28	4	6	4	14	81	12.8	9.75	8.07	20	9.3	12.25	11.6	10.1	194

6757	10316	4	I think that the author concludes with this paragraph bacuse she is determin to conpleat and pass the test. First reson way is that she faild this year and whants to pass next year. Next she is comparing the hibiscus to her passing and sulding on the test. That is way the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																						59	4	63	0	0	0	4.440677966101695	14.75	17	9	2	1	3	9	33	6.9	7.47	7.58	10	5.5	7.95	7.125	8.1	77
6760	10319	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by: Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng is try to adjust to @LOCATION1 coming from Vietnam. She is sad and misses her home, especially after failing her drivers test. She walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home. She buys it and takes it home in a pot. She says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant. Her mother then comes and shares the moment with her. Saeng feels better now. In the end sentence the author includes “saeng vowed silently to her herself, in the spring when the snows melt… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”(Ho, ??)  the flower has given her the conbidence to socceed and she wants to take the test again. This shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain.	2	2		2																						164	12	184	5	0	2	4.343373493975903	13.833333333333334	40	31	3	9	10	27	88	7.5	7.25	7.74	20	6.1	7.99	5.875	8.2	212
6762	10321	4	I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it’s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life’’. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she’ll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. So practically she’s stating once everything “come back to life” then she’ll feel like she will pass it next time. Now she can be prepared.	2	3		3																						147	8	159	2	0	0	4.333333333333333	18.375	22	31	7	14	5	20	84	7.1	7.07	6.92	12	4.9	7.61	10.6	8.2	182
6765	10324	4	The hibcus as the author has reveat to the audience is a beautiful flower who in the story is the memories of a young girl who has fail the test knowing she was to depress for her failing the test. The flower helps as a symbol of encourage to the sad girl in her most tragrant event and shows how a little flower gives comfort to the girl.The girl Saeng vowed to demonstrate that when she overcomes the sad memories. She’ll be able to be capable to prove she will pass, after she feels ok about the situation she is experiment with her destroy life after have to come to a different country where you mast have a @PERCENT1 of capacity and it’s logical that the adaptation of the girl is not going to be right away. In othe words, the author message it’s to motivate the people who has problems in their lifes and that life it’s not give up. Instead you should keep working hard until you get it. In conclusion working Hard and @CAPS1 give up it’s a part of our life and it’s up to our selves to overcome failing	2	2		2																						194	7	203	2	0	0	4.194871794871795	27.857142857142858	48	28	10	7	5	16	110	14.6	7.44	8.41	25	12.3	15.39	19.333333333333332	12.2	259
6795	10354	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the ending paragraph is there to show that Saeng has not given up. She says, “When they come back…then I will take that test again.” She is talking about the hibiscus and the geese. The things that remind her of home. When the reminders of home come and give her strength, she will have the power to take the test. This shows that even though she has failed she will not give up and she will try again. I think that is the purpose of the paragraph. To show Saeng hasn't given up.	2	2		2																						104	8	116	3	0	0	4.104761904761904	13.125	18	21	1	5	3	16	70	5.5	5.5	6.2	6	4.4	6.34	7.666666666666666	6.2	122
6797	10356	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho. The author is stating that Saeng is happy when she is around the plant and she finds peace with the plant because it brings back childhood memories. For example “And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton.” She loved the way it made her feel. When one of the leaves fell off and she breathed in, it remined her of grandmother. @CAPS1 might of experienced something like this. @CAPS1 might of wrote this because the story could relate to other people who moved from another country and have something that brought back memories. Everytime that l touch or smell a sweater,it brings back memorises of my grandmother.

6811	10370	4	The author concludes the story with this final paragraph to show how sentimental and important the plant is to Saeng. She will take that test again when the winter is over because it's too cold for nice hibiscus to survive. You need a winter hibiscus. “Not like the kind we had before “(@NUM1). This shows how important it is that she finds a hibiscus like the ones she had at home.

Saeng had become sad because she remembered her home in Vietnam. She longed for her natural home and familiarity. Her missed memories agonizingly hurt Saeng because she was now for away and in a different world. However, the author started to reveal hints that @ORGANIZATION1 would accept @LOCATION2 and find come childhood memories there too. “Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and –yes- familiar to Saeng now.” Already, Saeng was growing familiar with her surrounding area in @LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would keep her @CAPS1 culture, tradition, and memories alive, as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in @LOCATION2. As one kept her @CAPS1 and “@CAPS3 culture alive through memories, she would continue a successful life and pass her test. That is why Minfong Ho ended “Winter Hibiscus” with the particular paragraph.	3	2		3																						192	10	213	12	0	0	5.03125	19.2	52	30	18	13	10	32	92	14.3	11.32	8.03	29	11.5	12.93	12.4	13.6	284
6822	10381	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready. The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.	2	2		2																						59	5	64	0	0	0	4.661016949152542	11.8	10	13	3	3	2	5	32	6.4	8.4	6.63	6	5.5	6.08	5.7	8.2	80

For example Saeng started to cry because she miss her homeland.	1	1		1																						49	4	53	0	0	0	4.244897959183674	12.25	10	11	1	1	2	5	30	6.7	6.55	6.38	5	4.9	7.34	7.5	6.4	61
6833	10392	4	The author concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with the paragraph because it continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life. In the story, Saeng has come to the United States from Vietnam and it is quite a change. Also changed are the plants. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, but it is different. The mother in the story says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus. “The hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes. The final paragraph talks about snow melting, geese returning and the hibiscus budding. These are all changes the author uses to connect to the theme. This adds more understanding to the story’s message. Additionally, the tone of the last paragraph is hopeful, which gives the reader a positive feeling. The tone adds to the theme of the story.	2	3		3																						152	11	171	8	0	0	4.7894736842105265	13.818181818181818	47	16	12	7	4	27	77	8.7	9.16	7.71	19	6.9	7.92	8.5	9.4	214

6837	10396	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” includes “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again because it shows that she can adapt to change and still can think about her old country too. An example of how she can keep her old country alive in her life is” But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much perferred it to a Big Mac.” This shows that she can still eat the foods she ate back at her old home and try new things at her new home. In conclusion the excerpt shows that the author can put both cultures together and be happy.	2	2		2																						125	4	132	4	0	0	4.104	31.25	20	21	10	9	7	13	76	18.7	7.04	7.85	10	14.8	17.96	27.0	11.2	152

6857	10416	4	"The story  “Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho. The author concludes the story in a what seems like incomplete paragraph. The girl Saeng vows to take her driver test over when the spring comes. when Saeng was holding the plant, she felt cold and halpless like how the plant did. ""Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, it's leaves quivering in the wind."" By Saeng's mother reassuring her that she was okay with her choice it made Saeng grow as a person, ""I'm glad you got it."" @CAPS1 mother also says, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing."" That in a way describes Saeng clinging to stay connected with her country. Saeng’s mother also tells her of now the plant will surely survive. When the spring comes the plant will be just as strong, and so will Saeng. Which is why the author leaves off where she did"	1	3		2																						150	11	179	6	0	0	4.470198675496689	13.727272727272727	38	26	9	8	2	29	82	9.1	7.72	7.41	16	7.1	8.85	13.5	7.6	189
6860	10420	4	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to get some roots in the new soil she is on. When she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time.	2	1		2																						63	3	66	0	0	0	3.9365079365079363	21.0	14	10	5	1	2	2	36	7.6	5.28	6.93	5	6.8	9.67	11.5	8.8	76
6865	10425	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver’s test. “She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. “This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she’ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2.	2	2		2																						87	6	100	5	0	0	4.528735632183908	14.5	22	17	4	3	1	16	47	10.8	8.12	7.8	4	7.1	9.64	11.375	7.2	104
6875	10435	4	The author concluded the story with that ending because in the spring when everything blossoms. And she wouldnt be focused while there is snow. So when the hibiscus is budding, thats when she will be able to take her test again. I think he wrote that because it means something to her.	1	0		1																						52	4	59	1	0	0	4.5	13.0	7	10	1	2	1	5	37	6.3	7.35	6.41	6	4.8	6.74	6.25	8.1	68
6880	10440	4	The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing to indifferent things; Flowers & taking a test. That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence.	1	1		1																						43	4	49	0	0	0	4.813953488372093	10.75	13	7	2	1	1	6	21	7.0	9.02	7.92	4	6.2	7.06	5.125	8.1	61
6886	10446	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it connects the hibiscus back to the trials and triumphs of saeng . Just how saeng can’t give up .and must go back to retake the test, the winter hibiscus must make it through the hard, rough winter and come back strong . The hibiscus are a symbol of hope and saeng thinks of them as her hope. Throughout the story, the hibiscus are comforting to saeng because they remind her of home. The author includes this because many people can relate to this and find hope in things.  For saeng, knowing that each year the hibiscus will come back in those conditions, reassures her that she’ll be okay there as well.	2	2		2																						121	6	131	5	0	0	4.475409836065574	20.333333333333332	31	16	5	8	4	14	70	12.0	9.0	7.6	15	9.0	10.86	11.0	10.4	160
6889	10449	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."	1	1		1																						125	6	139	3	0	0	4.2936507936507935	21.0	19	19	11	10	11	13	80	9.3	7.2	6.06	6	6.7	8.96	11.2	8.8	152
6892	10452	4	The character, Saeng, experiences both internal and external conflicts. Saeng had failed her driver’s test and stilled missed Vietnam. The ending of the story was an excellent choice of conclusion for the story. The flock of @CAPS1 geese represented her changes. She used to foot awkward and out of places. Many things were new to her. Saeng realized that life isn't so bad for her. The planting of the “winter hibiscus” represented her change as well. It showed how she will start new and continue happily. Saeng will “plant a new seed.” The ending was well chosen for the story because it foreshadows Saeng’s future. The story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect.	2	2		2																						117	11	131	2	0	0	4.914529914529915	10.636363636363637	31	16	11	7	6	20	59	7.0	9.26	8.21	21	5.1	8.68	5.2	9.8	169
6893	10453	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng relates the hibiscus overcoming of problems to her own overcoming of problems. Saeng is comparing the hibiscus to herself. If the hibiscus can adapt to its surroundings, then so can she. And if the hibiscus makes it through the winter, then she too can make it; and she will re-take the test that she failed before. Also, before this she says that things that were once strange to her now seemed familiar, like the geese. She then see’s them overhead flying in a V. They are also adapting to their surroundings by flying to a warmer place, and Saeng too can adapt.	2	2		2																						114	6	128	5	0	0	4.56140350877193	19.0	21	19	4	12	3	16	76	8.2	8.18	7.49	11	6.1	8.27	7.428571428571429	10.0	152

6901	10461	4	The author decides to conclude the story with this paragraph to show the strength and confidence Saeng has. By saying she would try to pass the test again in the spring is showing she is confident and is looking for a new beginning to come then. Also he concludes it this way because after she failed the test she didn’t have much self-confidence. And once she spoke to her mother and knew she was understanding, Saeng knew she had to try again and perservire until she passed the test.	2	1		2																						89	4	96	1	0	0	4.47191011235955	22.25	17	21	3	4	5	8	54	10.7	8.54	7.76	10	8.4	10.27	12.375	9.5	116

6918	10478	4	I think the author puts that paragraph in the story because maybe because its a good luck thing or its a tradition so its very important that its in the story.

6921	10481	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph she did because the girl did not pass the driving test.

6929	10489	4	I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful.	0	0		0																						75	3	81	4	0	0	4.56	25.0	15	11	5	6	3	10	42	18.8	9.24	7.6	5	14.4	16.07	20.75	0.0	97
6931	10491	4	He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants.	1	2		2																						81	4	85	0	0	0	3.9876543209876543	20.25	17	13	2	6	3	6	49	7.5	5.51	6.01	5	6.5	9.11	10.625	7.2	97
6932	10492	4	In the story winter Hibiscus they end the story with that paragaph, because it repents that she is geting use to the new contrury.

6933	10493	4	The flowers on this bush are very comforting to Saeng. In the story she explains that they remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of plant and spring represent new life. Saeng thinks that spring could also have a new beginning for her. That in spring, she will do better and pass the test. But, if she falls again, the flowers will have bloomed to comfort her.	2	2		2																						69	6	78	3	0	0	4.3478260869565215	11.5	16	10	3	4	3	9	41	4.8	6.01	6.5	6	3.1	5.76	5.25	7.2	85
6934	10494	4	The author concludes with that because she kind of relates herself to the flowers. She has grown to her environment like a flower. Also she had failed her test, so just like when a flower dies and then comes back, she is going to come back and try the test again.	2	1		2																						51	3	56	2	0	0	4.176470588235294	17.0	7	9	0	9	2	5	32	6.8	6.09	6.65	4	6.4	7.58	7.833333333333334	6.4	64
6938	10498	4	The last paragraph in, ‘’Winter Hibiscus,’’ was add because the author want to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test. She feels disapointed because her mom is disapointed in her and knows she can pass it. While she stares at the Hibiscus then the geese flying in the air, she thinks that she does have a chance in passing the test. Now that she is determined to take the test, she is going to take it at the same time in the next year and she believes she is going to pass it.	2	1		2																						98	4	105	4	0	0	4.071428571428571	24.5	12	21	7	2	2	8	65	10.0	6.16	6.79	7	8.1	11.02	13.5	9.5	121
6947	10507	4	The author ended the story that way to show that Saeng won’t give up and is determined to complete her task. The author wants the reader to understand Saeng’s very sad and wants to overcome being homesick. Saeng is very much like the hibiscus plant, she’s frail and beautiful. Saeng says she will do her test again when the hibiscus is budding, almost like she’s growing along with the plant.	2	1		2																						70	4	76	2	0	0	4.614285714285714	17.5	18	13	3	6	3	10	36	9.0	8.7	7.44	7	6.6	8.14	9.0	9.5	92
6949	10509	4	One it could mean she can only take the test in the spring. But also because her surroundings during that period relaxed heR.

6967	10528	4	The ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story. It is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader. In the end of the story Winter Hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement. The conclusion encourages you to keep trying, because it states that next year when the flower blooms Saeng will re-take the test. This shows encouragement because has the drive to try again and to pass. The author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is strong and also seems to recap the stories meaning because all along Saeng keeps getting disapointed about the flower, her mother, and homeland encourage her to move on and try again.

6972	10533	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it was a good way to end the story off.

That paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles. Saeng is coming from another country and is facing challenges not only in the garden, but in her life as well. She had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, by saying ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” she truly shows her determination and how shes not afraid to overcome obstacles that will face her."	2	2		2																						117	6	128	5	0	0	4.589743589743589	19.5	24	22	3	7	7	13	71	11.9	9.12	7.63	15	10.1	11.75	11.6	11.2	164

The character @ORGANIZATION1 seemed depressed and always reminiscient of her past in Vietnam. When she sees the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers she ""brokedown and wept"", and she remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells the Jasmine. To make maTters worse for Saeng she failed her driving test, which is something that most teens find as a big disappointment. By this point in the story I felt sorry for @ORGANIZATION1 and I wonderd if things would get better for her because she was away from everything she knew and loved with just some memories and a winter hibiscus unlike the kind she had back at her name in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, @ORGANIZATION1 suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.”"	2	3		3																						159	6	175	5	0	0	4.9937106918239	26.5	42	21	12	7	9	20	91	15.3	11.2	8.43	26	12.4	12.86	12.2	12.7	240
6986	10549	4	In guessing that it means that when winter or spring or whatever its harder to grow that garden. Also mabe its a challenge of some sort to make the garden grow by that time of year.

6988	10551	4	To me I would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons. To explain it could mean new begining or starting over. For example, when the geese fly away and came back, that means that the @CAPS1 are changeing. So with that being said, the @CAPS1 changing or starting over could represent his chance to take test can start over, and he will get another chance.	2	1		2																						78	4	86	4	0	0	4.487179487179487	19.5	13	17	2	3	4	9	49	9.5	8.01	6.63	10	7.4	9.85	11.25	10.1	103
6991	10554	4	The author includes the exccept at the end for a meaning reason to Saeng. the hibiscus symbolizes everything, her home, her past, and her comfort. Saeng feels that if the flower can bloom, so can she. Which will enable her to get used to her new home and retake the test. It also resembles hope, because if the plant can make it through the winter and bloom in the spring, so can she. The author used this to connect the feelings of Saeng with the realistics of the flower bloomability.	2	1		2																						90	6	102	6	0	0	4.411111111111111	15.0	25	11	1	3	3	14	56	8.3	7.25	6.81	11	6.8	9.87	10.4	9.9	121
6993	10556	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how Saeng was Not going to give up. Throughout the story she had been feeling down. From when she failed the test and she misses Vietnam. So many things throughout where she and her mother lives reminds her of Vietnam. “She closed her eyes and breathed. in, deeply Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair....” This made her very imotional, to see how many things reminded her of Vietnam. The author ended like this to show how the experience of all this affected her.	1	1		1																						100	8	111	2	0	0	4.6138613861386135	12.625	20	17	6	5	3	11	61	10.5	8.99	7.94	12	7.6	9.6	11.0	8.8	129
6995	10558	4	The author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement. “When the geese come back … in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” This statement shows renewal and persistance. I think she added this because after realizing the plant can come back time and time again, even after the harsh weather, she knew she could do it too. She vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew  herself and get back on track. It conveys persistance also. The plant doesn’t die each season. It’s hardy and comes back. If the girl can be persistant and come back next year to retake the test, she will be considered persistant. I think the girl wants to be just like flower. She sees it as being indomitable, renewing and beautiful. No matter where the plant is being grown, it will always keep those traits.	2	2		2																						162	12	182	7	0	0	4.487804878048781	13.666666666666666	29	29	9	16	8	24	95	8.0	8.0	7.27	15	6.1	8.46	14.25	9.4	213
6996	10559	4	The reason for the author concluding the following is because she wants it to be known to the readers that saeng is not going to just give up because she fails it the first time. That she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make a effort. It states that saeng will retake the test again in the spring when the snow has done melted and geese returns and this hibiscus is budding. Not only was the hibiscus an important part to the story, it was a very important part to her life it help her move on a see how things change cause over time it will chage and develop and adapt to the changes around it. Yes it was a disappointment to her mother but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home. It might comforted her in a way. There was many different things probably going on where she was she missed the test it wasn’t home. She has to adjust and adapt to the situation that she is in.	2	3		3																						189	9	198	1	0	0	4.052910052910053	21.0	32	31	7	9	7	10	126	9.5	6.27	7.06	16	9.0	11.13	13.75	10.4	238
7001	10564	4	The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, “Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world” (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her “(Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus other things will make her ready for the test also. The story says, “It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center – just as she had known it would feel” (Ho).The feel of the hibiscus @MONTH1 remind Saeng of distsnt memories, like helping her grandmother with her hair. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test she will not fail.	2	3		3																						226	11	247	6	0	0	4.336283185840708	20.545454545454547	56	32	12	18	6	26	130	9.3	7.2	6.19	11	7.7	9.08	11.4	9.6	284
7004	10567	4	I think  the author concluded the story like that is because it was cold outside. I also think that the author is trying to say is that when she wrote this letter it was cold outside and she wouldn’t take the test until it was warm again because of the cold. ”In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again.”	0	0		0																						78	3	83	2	0	0	4.050632911392405	26.333333333333332	13	9	4	6	3	8	50	17.3	6.69	6.99	4	13.8	16.63	20.5	0.0	97
7007	10570	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with a resolution of Saeng in order to show how Saeng will not give up and how she is determined. The reference to the spring blossoms shows how Saeng will fight to survive through the hardships, which are represented by winter. Just like the hibiscus that struggles to adapt to a new home, Saeng is struggling to adapt to a new country the final paragraph provides a resolution to the internal conflict of Saeng throughout the story by suggesting that Saeng will succeed in taking the test. In conclusion, the final paragraph in the story “Winter Hibiscus” provides a resolution to the conflict in the story, and shows the reader Saeng’s determination.	2	2		2																						120	4	128	4	0	0	4.883333333333334	30.0	34	18	7	1	2	12	62	16.6	11.27	8.41	21	13.8	15.0	15.0	13.4	180
7010	10573	4	In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year.One reason she @MONTH1 have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test. Also the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam it gave her the confidense to go out and get what she wanted.	1	2		2																						79	3	84	1	0	0	3.925	26.666666666666668	15	14	2	1	3	8	56	17.0	5.99	7.79	7	14.0	16.81	20.75	0.0	96
7011	10574	4	The author includes this in the paragraph to simply be sarcastic for you to know that it is almost impossible for Saeng to take the test afresh. I say this because she was being very sarcastic meaning she’s not going to take the test. For example, if someone were to tell me take a test and I said whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then I’ll take the test. That would be very sarcastic meaning that it wont happen and I’m not taking the test, instead of just saying No. The author included that just to let you know that the chances of her taking the test is very low.	0	0		0																						109	5	118	3	0	0	4.275229357798165	21.8	19	17	5	10	2	12	69	9.6	7.02	7.18	10	8.3	10.55	11.8	10.8	145
7013	10576	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show @CAPS1 strength and encouragement. When she’s willing and able she will take the test again with more confidence. Saeng says this to herself to help her get through until she can drive. She’s saying by next spring she’ll take her test. By next spring she’ll be able to drive. By next spring she’ll be used to her new home. This paragraph tells that it takes time to do things you don’t always get it right away so keep trying.	2	2		2																						89	7	96	0	0	0	4.46067415730337	12.714285714285714	20	18	8	6	2	11	51	5.9	7.18	7.28	7	3.5	5.98	5.642857142857143	6.2	106
7017	10580	4	"At the end of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story through stating, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author ends the story in such a way in order to reveal the hope that lies in Saeng's future. After failing her drivers's test, Saeng returns home with disappointment and sadness. This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck will change. The reader is left with a hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is @CAPS1. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United states instead of her home. Her success in fitting in with her new life is shown when through the quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before. had become... almost familiar"". Truly Saeng is a determined character."	2	3		3																						186	10	218	13	0	0	4.806451612903226	18.6	49	28	9	17	4	31	104	11.6	9.52	7.8	25	9.0	10.22	10.8	9.7	254
7018	10581	4	The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next @DATE1. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome.

7026	10590	4	I believe that the Author ended the story with this paragraph, because I think it is showing that Saeng isn’t a quiter. Saeng can’t wait until the Hibiscus comes back. When the Hibiscus comes back she’ll retake the test and show her mother that she can do it.	1	1		1																						48	3	52	1	0	0	4.416666666666667	16.0	12	10	0	2	1	8	27	7.4	7.54	8.05	5	6.0	7.23	7.666666666666666	7.8	63
7028	10592	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes.	3	3		3																						231	14	266	13	0	0	5.191489361702128	16.785714285714285	81	34	9	10	6	31	106	11.7	12.12	7.67	37	8.5	9.89	10.833333333333334	12.5	355
7032	10596	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng really wants to pass the test. You knows this when it says “And in the warm moist shelter of the green house, saeng broke down and wept.” This passage shows that she didn’t want to fail.

The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus.

Also, it says that this girl is determined and she won’t stop trying till she gets it right. Next, this last paragraph can tell you about the whole story.

7238	11986	5	The author of this memoir gave the memoir a peaceful mood. This memoir focused mainly on friends and family getting together to celebrate. It made it peaceful because the author gives the reader the feeling that their was nothing to worry about. The author never mentioned any negative activity in the memoir. He just explained how he was very thankful for how his parents raised him and the lessons that his parents taught him. He mentioned how thankful he was for his parents since they were willing to sacrafice things in their lives for the benefit of their children. The author made the reader feel like Narciso was protected in the house he lived in because all his neighbors were so united with each other that they were all friendly to each other so there was nothing to worry about. They all cared for each other so they would protect each other if anythin bad were to happen which gives the memoir a peaceful and worryless mood. The author talks about how his house was simple, warm, humble, and full of his memories which is another reason I think the memoir had a peaceful mood. When you read the memoir, you can see how the author only talked about good things and a worryless life which really gives the memoir a peaceful mood. These are some reasons that show how this memoir has a peaceful mood given by the author who wrote it.	4	3		4																						243	11	258	4	0	0	4.534979423868313	22.09090909090909	44	34	24	11	5	14	150	11.0	8.65	6.62	18	9.5	9.99	8.333333333333334	9.1	330

I also think that the fact that a small, simple apartment they lived in is very important to Narciso because he repeats it several times. I think he does this to show a thoughtful for mood, in that the house was small but through creativity in bringing culture in made it seem much bigger.	3	4		4																						191	7	207	8	0	0	4.7539267015706805	27.285714285714285	42	29	23	7	7	17	106	14.6	10.1	7.64	24	11.6	12.18	15.25	11.2	271

That he uses good detail in decribing the home of the character. For example, @CAPS1 Cuban music (which I adore to this day). This shows that there was some beautifull cultural music.Another way is that he is in a cultral mood is when he says. ""My young parents created our traditional cuban home."" This shows that they took what they had in Cuba and brang it to @LOCATION1. Also that they wanted it to be like home in which they miss.In this memoir there @MONTH1 have been other ways to describe the mood of what the author created. But I think the cultral mood is one of the bigger ones.

I also belive its a basic mood because it says that ""kids have to do a lot of the work"" because They are the youngest and the older can't do that work or they will get hurt.

Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The language used (grateful) shows the intence thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word ""grateful"" is used repeadtly. The use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important. So grateful appears to be a keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age"" There is so much passion in this phrase. ""There is no way to express my gratitude"" shows that he's just so thankful there is not way to even express it.

Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.	1	1		1																						76	3	79	0	0	0	4.2105263157894735	25.333333333333332	17	14	3	5	1	3	47	11.1	7.2	6.97	8	10.8	11.17	13.666666666666666	8.8	104
3660	6056	3	The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author. The affect was bad rather that good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoltering temperatures. Another feature that had a great impeidence on the author’s well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbed across at the snack. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when author tried to get water. There was also Brackish water in the that tasted suspiciously like Battery acid.	1	1		1																						102	7	112	1	0	0	4.647058823529412	14.571428571428571	26	11	11	6	2	13	61	7.8	8.58	7.77	16	6.6	8.19	7.2857142857142865	9.2	144
3663	6059	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over, “short rolling hills,” and arround a,“ridiculously large snake,” and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut.

3672	6068	3	The setting and it`s features affect the cyclist greatly. He is in the desert and all the town's are abandoned. Also he now hits a sign that says “Rough Road Ahead…(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1). This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up, old, beaten roads.

3677	6073	3	The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn’t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn’t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch’s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination.	2	1		2																						167	11	189	8	0	0	4.580838323353293	15.181818181818182	36	28	13	12	10	22	95	7.7	8.0	7.98	23	6.9	8.48	7.0	9.1	226

3698	6094	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him.	1	1		1																						124	9	138	5	0	0	4.112903225806452	13.777777777777779	25	19	11	7	4	12	77	4.8	5.33	5.98	10	4.0	6.17	5.5	6.4	153

Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt.

3713	6109	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the mood the cyclist and what happens as he journeys in the desert to a town. For example his mood changes when the old man asks him for a map and his attitude changes by cautiousness of the new, of the new road he went on then terror when he thought he was gonna die “ I was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean” then to pride when the old man asks for a map and the author says “I own a very good map” But as he journeys to Yosemite the setting changes when he goes to a  desert type of place then goes a bait shop to rest. Then probably on his merry way to his destination.	2	2		2																						131	5	138	1	0	0	3.8106060606060606	26.4	34	20	6	6	5	10	71	18.4	5.65	8.34	11	15.6	19.01	26.5	10.5	155
3719	6115	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting.

3724	6120	3	In the story there are many affects the cyclist deals with. He has to go through a lot of bad things just to finish. The cyclist has to watch out for a rough road he was going over. Also the whole time he was racing he had to watch out for diamond back snackes. Also the whole race, the cyclist biggest problem was water. He ran out quickly. And when he saw the factory and stopped. He put rocks in his mouth to make him forget about water, and lets yours split circulate.

3732	6128	3	During his cycling trip, the author had to endure extreme heat, face snakes, deal with little or no shade and survive a dire lack of water, all problems related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes of becoming dehydrated, and describes, “the sun was beginning to beat down and l was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 struggle for him was crossing the path of a “ridiculously large snake” and “trying to keep his balance in his dehydrates state. Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme heat, and upon reaching a water pump, finds the water to be unfit for drinking and “in the neighborhood of zoo degrees.” @CAPS1 setting-related issue for kurmaskie was the fact the area seemed deserted and he had to continue for mile until he was able to find a spot with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate.	3	2		3																						156	3	172	11	0	0	4.705128205128205	52.0	46	27	11	1	9	23	75	26.8	10.17	10.16	27	21.2	23.62	20.333333333333332	16.7	225
3733	6129	3	The features of the setting were very affective in the story “@CAPS1’t exceed @CAPS2 Speed Limit.” It affected the cyclist because in one part of the setting it went to roling hills. That’s going to be hard to pedal a bike on. Another was the setting affected the cyclist is at one point tumbleweeds were in his way. If the gets caught on the bike it could have caused him to fall and it could harm him. Lastly, the road started getting rough up ahead which could be hard to ride over potholes and thugs like that. Therefore, the setting was affecting to the cyclist.	2	2		2																						105	6	113	2	0	0	4.40952380952381	17.5	24	15	4	4	2	13	59	8.1	7.36	7.96	16	6.6	8.52	8.166666666666666	8.8	139
3743	6139	3	In the short story, ”Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist faced with many problems. One of these is the feature of setting. I believe it has a big affect. The setting is in a dessert, which is very hot, there is no water around and usually nobody lives in a dessert. @CAPS1 thing is that he was running out of water. In the text it says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.“ @CAPS1 setting of the book that affects the cyclist is that it is in June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist is in a dessert traveling many miles.	2	2		2																						106	7	119	6	0	0	4.264150943396227	15.142857142857142	31	10	7	6	1	17	60	7.5	6.26	7.2	12	6.7	8.59	7.833333333333334	7.8	139
3744	6140	3	The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable. Riding on rough roads, braking, speeding, chains in good conditions. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These typess of things @MONTH1 help determine how settings can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						126	8	138	4	0	0	4.484126984126984	15.75	30	13	15	4	1	16	70	7.5	7.83	7.68	16	5.9	6.95	6.428571428571429	6.6	162
3754	6150	3	In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions were from elder men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to decide which way to take when there was a fork in the road. He chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into flat roads that went to rolling hills, snakes blocking his path, and a dehydration state that could’ve killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																						114	6	131	11	0	0	4.666666666666667	19.0	40	18	5	2	2	17	56	10.1	8.94	8.04	16	8.3	11.11	12.0	11.5	156
3755	6151	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist in various different ways.

The odds are against him from the start “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…”(Kurmaskie @NUM1) From the ganle you can tell that hes tired and almost out of water.

3760	6156	3	The feature’s of the setting affect the cyclist because, the cyclist is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he’s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn’t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. “Rough road ahead.”  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						122	6	134	5	0	0	4.373983739837398	20.5	29	17	9	4	5	17	69	14.5	8.31	8.26	15	12.8	13.51	13.5	10.1	168
3763	6159	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. It affected him because it was saying @NUM1 miles and then were in the first town, thinking that the cyclist was getting excited and he was kind of all most done he thought he was going at a fast past. When the cyclist got to the first town he said that it looked dead. And then after he kept moving he kind of knew that he wasnt getting anywhere. Then after thinking he noticed that he had listened to some old folks that had never even been off their porch. So after the cyclist had hit the first town he had known right then and there that ho should never listen to old folkes ever again. Because that first town had looked like nobody has been in it for years.	2	2		2																						138	7	147	1	0	0	4.181159420289855	19.714285714285715	17	23	9	18	4	10	90	8.1	6.62	6.1	8	6.3	8.17	10.6	6.9	171
3790	6186	3	In this I will tell you how the cyclist was being effected. One way is the heat caused him to drink more then her ran out of water.

3795	6191	3	Theres many features of the setting that affect the cyclest. His dehidration started with the sun beeting down on him and the thirst for water. He was mainly affected when he was out of water and road by an abbanond welchs grape juice factory. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.” Then when he had almost nothing left he spoted a bait shop.” Somehow I climed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.” @CAPS1 is when he saw “Gary and @CAPS2 Fish camp – If you want bait far the big ones were your best bet thus realcaving his troubles.	2	2		2																						142	9	152	4	0	0	4.415492957746479	15.777777777777779	37	20	9	13	5	24	71	17.1	8.31	9.07	23	13.6	15.89	14.0	11.2	188
3808	6204	3	In the essay “Do not exceed posted spedd limit” by @PERSON1 many features of the setting effect the cyclist. First, when he arrived at the first “town” and said, “this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war.” This deserted ghost town setting was like a joke and had a small effect on the cyclist because it was the beginning of the day and he still had a good water supply. Though when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps the effect it had wasn’t so mild. He says, “The sight was troubling.” Then when he got on his hands and knees and started working the pump the situation didn’t get much better. All that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid. Lastly, when he arrived at an abandoned welch’s Grape juice factory after several miles. This had a very wearing effect on him since the water supply was low and he had cycled into disappointment after disappointment. This setting in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless. It was only determination that got this cyclist through it.	1	1		1																						197	12	211	5	0	0	4.532994923857868	16.416666666666668	53	26	13	9	8	27	109	10.9	8.53	7.93	25	9.5	9.78	18.0	9.2	269

3820	6216	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” time setting very much affects the cyclist during the story. One of the things that affect him during the story is that it was a very hot, sun scorching day. Also he ran out of water and there was nothing but desert and poisonous snakes around. Another thing is that when he ran out of water there was no snakes warmers  just desert so he started to become very thirsty. In the essay it also said he reached a part where she saw a sign that said “ Rough Road Ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limited, so the road conditions starting to get rough him that was another affect. In the end of the essay he reaches a camp where it is all peace and relaxed, and they have cold water there, this affects him because he feels replenished.

3844	6240	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting effects how fast, hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal. For example, “…Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was going 12 mph, where the speed limit was 55 mph. The cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign, but he kept going. Furthermore, not only was the land add pressure to the cyclist. So does the heat from the sun. For instance, the cyclist says, “… and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…”. The heat begins to affect the authors health and his perseverance. The setting affect the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure.	2	3		3																						131	9	150	8	0	0	4.544776119402985	14.88888888888889	41	23	4	6	5	23	57	7.7	8.23	7.98	23	6.6	7.67	6.857142857142857	8.2	182

3855	6251	3	The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, affect the cyclist because the cyclist is in a desert with no water and trying to find a town there is further than he thinks. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This shows the cyclist did not have much confidens in this desolates area of the jerny.	1	1		1																						68	3	71	1	0	0	4.1911764705882355	22.666666666666668	19	12	2	0	2	7	39	32.3	7.86	10.72	10	26.3	28.96	37.0	0.0	88

There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. “This site was trebling.”  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn’t good. “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees”. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he can’t believe his luck.” Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me “The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks.	3	2		3																						183	10	199	7	1	0	4.206521739130435	18.4	37	27	19	13	7	30	95	13.7	7.15	8.77	20	11.6	12.42	12.5	7.2	229

3871	6267	3	The setting of the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.” It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on “the sun was beginning to beat down” He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. “I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. “The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on.	2	3		3																						191	13	214	5	0	0	4.602094240837697	14.692307692307692	40	23	23	14	12	27	101	8.9	8.41	6.9	24	7.7	9.05	11.8	11.0	273
3872	6268	3	As the cyclist begins his journey, he is confident & exited to have been offered new directions from some “old wise men” which promise a shortcut. This water supply is mediocre & attitude willed against the flat and hilly terrain, untill he realizes the directions are way off  target. The cyclist was making his way to Yosemite when he came to the first “town” but it wasn't a town but more of a ghost dwelling. As he continued hoping the shortcut offered by the old “codgens” would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the hot desert wt a depleting water supply & dwindling spirit. He was disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men and through his his pain & dispair, encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt skrewed over, yet through his will & determination, by rationing water & mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physicall, emotional & mental trials and lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old “ codgers” on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be out datted.	3	3		3																						200	6	217	9	0	0	4.681592039800995	33.5	43	31	16	13	12	24	100	17.6	10.86	9.57	44	14.7	17.03	15.5	14.1	298
3884	6280	3	The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds.

One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me”. This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was confused. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels @NUM1 degrees. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” That quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. ""@CAPS1 road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made the biker have to work harder, and use more energy.

3896	6292	3	During the cyclist’s trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the “shortcut” was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, “ there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn’t anybody nearby to help him and there wasn’t any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie’s physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, “ the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position.	3	2		3																						192	10	210	8	0	0	4.901041666666667	19.2	51	28	15	11	8	24	101	12.3	10.5	8.31	36	10.4	11.85	12.2	11.9	280

He’s showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much he’s indespair at the time. When he says “It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” In this quote he is saying that he @MONTH1 be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows he’s not in a good shape and he knows he’s in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do.	2	3		3																						178	6	188	6	0	0	4.151685393258427	29.666666666666668	33	25	13	13	14	16	108	20.4	7.27	8.59	16	17.1	18.92	17.333333333333332	10.1	223

3926	6322	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the “beautiful @DATE1.” He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. But that’s not the worst of it. The hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker. There are also no places to stop for water.

3933	6329	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confidence, determination and relief. For example he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up. He first felt confident when the old people on the porch told him how to go and then at the end when he says he will listen to his map next time. He was also was determined because he wanted to get to the next town which he does, that also makes him relived, and wants to get to Yosemite National Park.

3948	6344	3	The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. The were hills that made his ride difficult. It says, “over one long cripping hill, a bulding came into view.” This shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling. Another thing in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty and becomes he to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ''by the looks of a had beth a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant.” These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																						95	6	104	3	0	0	4.6947368421052635	15.833333333333334	23	13	7	3	3	13	51	10.2	9.17	7.9	13	8.3	9.71	11.5	11.2	133
3950	6346	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclists in a big way because roads had bottles in then that could have caused him to get really hurt. Also, the water he was drinking was streaming and tasted like battery acid. Then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him. The setting was pretty baron for the cyclist because he also come across a snake. Last, he thought he saw some mirages that tells me that the climate is extreme for the cyclists.

3964	6360	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, A cyclist set out on a bike ride in the heat of summer in California where he will staying he met some old people who gave him a “short cut”. As he forms out most of the places he was told about were abandoned ghost towns without a single drop of drinkable water. If he were in a different setting like by a river or spring he would just stop and drink from that. Or even if he was in a more populated, industriated area he could stop in any building and ask for a drink; But he was in the dry, hot, abadond hills of California without any water. Under these conditions he grew tired, thirsty; dehydrated; and desperate for a drink finally he came apon a bait shop that had water there	2	2		2																						143	4	154	5	0	0	4.146853146853147	35.75	34	17	12	5	6	17	80	12.4	6.86	7.48	11	10.9	13.4	13.75	11.2	186
3969	6365	3	The features of setting affect the author because it moves him dehydrated. The dessert sun look sweat out of him and he had no water to bring that would replace his electrolites . Also, once the author had got into the hills he had lost a lot of his energy so peddling up his was a lot of work.

3973	6369	3	The setting is hot like desert, no one around, and very dry. Being hot outside affects the cyclist because he is sweaty and needs water. The heat wears him down. Having no one around causes him to not get water which he needs for his journey.

3978	6374	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thought he packed enough water so he began on his way he drank most of his water less than half way to his destination. He didn’t realize how hot it was until he got down to his last couple of sips of water. He started to become dehydrated he rembered the old men said that the next town was abait eighteen miles away so he kept on going when he reached the town there was nothing to drink just an old run down factory. He took same rocks and sucked on them, he went over a bump had swallowed it. He said to him self next time he would just go by what the map said everything he had gone past on the way had been run down and abandoned.

3982	6378	3	The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story the setting is a hot dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seems to start have an effect on him about after he reaches the first town. I know this by his statement.”This place might have been a thriving little spot at time –say, before the last war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chucked, checked my water supply and moved on. The the sun was beginning to beat down. The summer heat is thriving how during this @DATE1 and he is drinking lots of water.”So this setting does affect him greatly it causes him to use his water supply and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration. I know how the summer heat can affect you during @DATE1 activity ‘s. At times it feelslike you are going to die but that building is always around the bend just for the cyclist.	3	2		3																						177	9	190	2	0	0	4.372881355932203	19.666666666666668	44	25	8	5	5	15	102	9.0	7.54	7.29	20	8.6	9.24	8.166666666666666	8.8	240

""@CAPS1 through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over “short, rolling hills.” Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn’t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits “the traditional definition of a ghost town” and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path.

While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road.

I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story “who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welch’s factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain.	3	3		3																						151	8	160	1	0	0	4.470198675496689	18.875	35	26	9	10	4	14	85	9.1	8.3	8.23	20	7.1	9.41	8.5	8.8	202
3993	6389	3	The features of the setting directly affects the cyclist. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This affects the cyclist because in June it is very hot and going through a desert makes it worse, so he would continue to drink water until he has no more. He is also using energy which is making him sweat and drink more water. “One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me.” This could also cause a problem because he can’t renew his water source, which means he has to conserve it, and can’t use as much energy. Both of these things factor into the setting, in a desert with no water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day.	2	2		2																						132	7	143	5	0	0	4.46969696969697	18.857142857142858	30	22	11	8	4	17	72	16.1	8.66	8.38	18	13.8	15.02	18.666666666666668	11.2	179
4001	6397	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit.” The feautures of the of the area the cyclists rides through affect him greatly. For example when the narration says, “At some point, humble weeds crossed my path” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The tone of the cyclists from the quote above shows despare creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, “@CAPS1 hill, a building came into view” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist sounds more hopfull than before. That is how the area the cyclist enters affects him.	2	2		2																						92	6	107	5	0	0	4.923913043478261	15.333333333333334	32	12	4	5	0	19	42	9.4	9.5	9.03	18	6.9	7.42	7.833333333333334	9.3	129
4004	6400	3	The terrain described in this essay add affect to the strugles of the cyclist. For example when the author says “their were no cars nor buildings in sight” that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere. Also it adds a lot of affect when he comes upon an abandond juice factory and he is so thirsty he puts stones in his mouth to gather saliva. Also when he finally finds water an “oldtimer” asks if he knows the best way to go.	2	2		2																						89	4	93	0	0	0	4.089887640449438	22.25	22	13	2	7	2	9	51	9.0	6.45	8.29	10	8.4	9.37	12.125	8.8	115
4005	6401	3	In the essay the cyclist is riding in the desert. It is extremely hot out because it’s June and that causes alot of problems for him. He said that since it was so hot he was afaid of getting dihydrated. Also he explains that the roads were getting hilly, which would have caused him to work harder, meaning he was lossing my water.	2	2		2																						63	4	69	2	0	0	4.26984126984127	15.75	9	11	2	5	1	7	37	6.6	6.61	8.18	10	5.9	7.59	7.375	7.2	82
4006	6402	3	The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first “town”, he could tell there’d be some issue. It was a deserted, run down area. The water was hot. Down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills. There was a big snake in the road. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water.	2	2		2																						70	7	79	2	0	0	4.457142857142857	10.0	17	10	7	2	0	10	38	4.6	6.35	6.84	9	3.7	5.71	4.571428571428571	7.4	94

4022	6418	3	The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, “…@CAPS1 blues tune ‘summer time’ rattled around in…my deteriorating brain.” The author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down. It’s also because there is very little water left for him. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it’s the author v.s nature. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, “…haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” The word has greatly changed. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. The towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author.	2	2		2																						140	10	162	9	0	0	4.664335664335664	14.3	42	18	12	8	5	27	68	9.7	9.16	7.89	18	7.8	8.43	8.5	8.8	192
4023	6419	3	As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclist’s attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, “with strong legs and a smile on my face”. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men’s travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn’t help but laugh. “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. “At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map.	3	3		3																						207	8	231	16	0	0	4.570048309178744	25.875	47	33	13	11	6	30	116	17.3	9.12	8.17	30	14.4	16.51	14.5	12.2	287
4031	6427	3	"In the start story “Do not exceed speed limit,” time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of california in June. The fact that the story took place in June (and especially in a California desert) really is what caused the cyclist’s dehydration. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual. This heat cause the dehydration and the ""growing realization that I (the author)"	1	1		1																						88	5	99	3	0	0	4.761363636363637	17.6	31	9	4	4	5	14	42	9.8	9.28	7.92	12	7.8	9.31	10.4	10.4	127
4035	6431	3	The setting in the story affect the cyclist alot. It is June in the California desert. The sun is heating down on him. Another problem that he faces is that there is a very rough terrain. All of this together makes him drink up his water even faster. The setting is making him feel very disprate when is even worse.	1	1		1																						60	6	66	0	0	0	4.266666666666667	10.0	11	8	4	6	0	7	37	3.7	5.43	7.03	7	3.7	4.67	4.5	7.2	78
4036	6432	3	Each person has a really good ability that stands out. Someone can be good looking, smart or confident. Someone @MONTH1 never give up and do what he wishes to do. The cyclist in the story is or man with a strong will. He wants to be alive. He saw too many difficult in his way to get the place he wanted to be. He listened to some old guys and he lost his way. The sun was beginning to beat down. He was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal. He was losing his strength. The weather  was @NUM1’@CAPS1.The  water  tasted  like  acid battery. He  believed  himself  that he can be alive. He got stronger by believing in himself eventhough he was losing strength. Every place that he passed by was a new experienced for life. They were like a game that he came successful. He never give up. He did everything he could do to not losing his mind. He didn’t want lose the battle in his mind.	2	3		3																						173	18	200	1	0	0	4.033149171270718	10.055555555555555	27	33	14	4	5	20	106	3.0	4.67	6.76	19	3.5	5.46	4.6	7.6	232
4046	6442	3	In this story it seems as if everything is dry. The rider would be getting real thirsty. He is all by himself that would make any man feel strong, because if you have an ascedent that nobody would be there to help. Hes going up and down steep hills so he would have to be careful.	1	1		1																						56	4	62	1	0	0	4.017857142857143	14.0	5	8	5	4	1	6	41	4.5	4.92	5.46	1	4.0	5.6	6.25	6.0	68
4056	6452	3	The humid climate and hot weather will want to make you keep over if you don’t have water in your possesion. Like near the end of the essay the person sucked on stones to try retain water better which never heard about it its time. This weather is the cause of the character ??? dihydration which is a symptom of lack of water in the body.	1	1		1																						66	4	71	0	0	3	4.151515151515151	16.5	18	9	3	1	1	6	36	9.3	6.62	7.87	8	8.2	10.53	12.0	8.8	87

The heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired. For example the text states."" I could die form a heatstroke on a gergeous day in June."" this shows that it was extremly hot. The cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty. For example it states in the text."" I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water. The last way the setting affects the cyclist is when he goes into a town and tieds it empty. The text states,"" on that morning it fit the traditional detinition at a ghost town."" This show that he expected it to be there so he could rest but it wasn't like it was appare to be things all show how the setting affected th cyclist."	2	2		2																						168	13	194	4	0	0	4.220238095238095	12.923076923076923	39	24	12	6	4	24	96	5.4	5.68	7.15	20	5.2	7.5	5.111111111111111	8.1	217
4065	6461	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a couple of ways. The first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert. This caused him to sweat badly and get very dehydrated. The seconded way was that there were rough roads and hilly snotts this made him more tired faster. In conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit.	2	2		2																						66	5	71	0	0	0	4.348484848484849	13.2	13	8	7	5	3	6	39	5.7	6.6	7.64	7	3.7	7.1	6.2	7.6	82
4067	6463	3	Many things on the cyclist journey affected him. It was in the middle of summer in California. The heat is unbeleivable and rediculously hot. “… I could drop from heatstroke…” he was so bad overheated and dyhdrated that he could of died any minute. He could have also been killed by a giant snake. “…look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement…” It could have easily killed him, if he wasn’t careful. But with his determination and spite he pulled threw and made it to a fresh supply of water. If he would have gaven up his life would have been over.	3	3		3																						107	8	120	1	0	0	4.198198198198198	13.875	20	12	10	5	6	19	63	8.0	7.07	7.47	13	6.7	10.86	9.0	10.5	143
4072	6468	3	The setting is the main factor on effects on the cycleist. The cycleist’s main problem is that he is low on water & dehydrated, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The author wouldn’t have been so dehydrated if it weren’t so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake & the rough road. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldn’t have been any conflicts.	2	2		2																						78	5	85	3	0	0	4.397435897435898	15.6	16	7	9	5	2	12	42	9.3	8.12	8.32	10	8.3	8.65	10.75	8.8	106
4076	6472	3	In the essay “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, “cool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.”The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, “One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest Mule greet me.”there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried. The last example was, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well. As his route ends he comes across in manymore aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability.	3	3		3																						188	10	210	9	0	0	5.053191489361702	18.8	49	28	22	10	12	27	90	14.1	11.55	9.76	41	11.3	12.38	15.75	12.8	274
4081	6477	3	On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their direction aren’t so good. The desserted place affected him because there was no where for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. There were rusted water pump’s, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration.	2	2		2																						83	4	93	7	0	0	4.409638554216867	20.75	22	11	6	1	5	14	46	9.7	7.54	7.33	10	7.9	10.73	11.875	10.1	109
4087	6483	3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement “I was travelling through the high deserts of California.” not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement “I was travelling in June.” @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, “blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also “had the flavor of battery acid.” This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he “had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.” The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink.	3	3		3																						275	14	305	15	0	0	4.592727272727273	19.642857142857142	66	27	22	15	3	34	161	12.7	8.88	6.77	26	10.7	11.31	8.666666666666666	10.2	379
4090	6486	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the setting. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert like area, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through.	2	2		2																						87	4	95	4	0	0	4.32183908045977	21.75	18	12	5	4	2	9	53	9.8	7.25	7.08	7	8.3	10.56	12.125	9.5	113
4093	6489	3	The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn’t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay.	2	2		2																						101	4	111	6	0	0	4.0495049504950495	25.25	14	16	5	9	8	10	69	10.3	5.93	7.39	8	9.6	12.5	14.25	10.7	128
4103	6499	3	The features that effect the cyclist are that he is riding his bike in the desert and doesnt have any water. That effects his journey because he is dehydrated so he needs to find water fast so it is making him get to Yosemite slower because he needs to find water. That is a feature that affects the cyclist	1	1		1																						59	3	62	0	0	0	4.220338983050848	19.666666666666668	11	12	0	2	1	1	36	8.3	7.02	7.83	9	7.4	8.56	10.166666666666666	6.4	79
4107	6503	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe @PERSON1 it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the problems he faced. For example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story it said “Drop from heatstroke.” this shows the setting affected him in a negative way, in the story heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character.	2	1		2																						70	3	75	2	0	0	4.3428571428571425	23.333333333333332	25	8	3	0	1	8	35	10.7	7.61	8.4	11	10.0	12.18	13.666666666666666	11.2	96
4108	6504	3	The features of the setting affected the author’s story a lot. It affected it by making the trip seem more difficult to the reader. This was made possible by telling how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says “over one long, crippling hill.” This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills. But if the road wasn’t as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult. This would also make it as if that the old guys gave good directions. But the whole point.	1	1		1																						104	7	112	1	0	0	4.173076923076923	14.857142857142858	20	16	12	7	4	11	62	5.6	5.85	6.65	6	4.4	7.5	8.5	8.8	129
4109	6505	3	As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They  gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down. As he headed down the road, he encountered various small towns-none of which looked promising- which gave him a feeling of despair, in accordance to his lack of water. Even further  into. the journey, he found one last town, and arundown welche’s  @CAPS1 factory. This increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner. It made him realize to never again trust the old men.	3	3		3																						133	9	155	8	0	0	4.4338235294117645	15.11111111111111	30	20	10	9	5	23	76	8.1	7.71	7.78	17	7.4	9.05	8.666666666666666	9.5	181
4116	6512	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can’t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can‘t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn’t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink.	2	3		3																						194	15	220	11	0	0	4.190721649484536	12.933333333333334	37	37	8	9	5	24	118	4.8	5.38	6.31	13	3.6	5.78	4.1	5.7	238
4121	6517	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike the roads also would make him work harder.	1	1		1																						57	5	62	0	0	0	4.192982456140351	11.4	12	9	6	6	1	5	31	4.0	5.37	7.8	7	3.0	6.67	5.3	7.6	70
4122	6518	3	The features of the setting affected the cycalist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didn’t know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						58	4	61	0	0	0	4.344827586206897	14.5	14	11	3	1	1	7	32	6.3	6.95	8.98	11	6.6	9.25	7.75	10.1	83
4124	6520	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are “cool pines and rushing rivers,” however, the cyclist comes to find that the “rushing river” is not so refreshing. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills. There is a sign, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which cause him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him he’d be better off using his map.	2	1		2																						159	7	179	15	0	0	4.371069182389937	22.714285714285715	43	24	9	9	2	27	80	10.5	7.55	7.54	16	8.6	10.09	10.8	9.6	214
4125	6521	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water. The ghost town doesn’t help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abanded. This is how the features affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						96	7	103	2	0	0	4.041666666666667	13.714285714285714	22	13	6	0	3	7	58	7.2	5.75	6.56	7	7.2	8.1	9.0	6.7	121
4126	6522	3	Features of the setting would affect me if I was the cyclist because, I would be thinking I was going to die just like he did because, there is nothing to look at, no breeze, wind, he seen a snake, he had no water. He went through three towns that had nothing. The sun was setting down on him, it was hot, he had no hope. Who knows, maybe if he would have just went with what the map had said, he would have been fine.	2	2		2																						86	4	100	10	0	0	3.872093023255814	21.5	11	16	2	3	0	13	60	7.5	4.24	5.8	4	5.8	8.6	10.75	3.1	98
4131	6527	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. In the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. Also because he was in the desert he had no sense of direction. Also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn’t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water.	2	2		2																						97	6	104	1	0	0	4.206185567010309	16.166666666666668	19	12	4	7	3	8	62	6.5	6.38	6.39	7	6.1	7.3	7.75	7.8	128
4134	6530	3	The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn’t get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few “tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge,” By the lols of it had been a Welch’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory.” He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a “Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” There is only the problems it is abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth. This was to help tabe his mind off being thirst.	3	2		3																						299	23	324	6	0	0	4.050167224080267	13.0	60	39	18	13	11	37	182	5.1	5.04	7.18	29	5.6	6.8	5.5	7.0	375
4137	6533	3	The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist. For example.” I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts of California especially in June are hot and dry and caused the cyclist to use much of his water supply, very quickly. As he “toiled” on, the terrain features became even more trying,” over one long, crippling hill…”By this time the cyclist barely had enough energy to make it over a hill from all the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting.	2	2		2																						97	3	104	4	0	0	4.5	32.666666666666664	27	10	9	5	3	12	56	16.2	9.12	7.84	12	13.5	15.39	18.5	11.9	131

4163	6559	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance the desert is not a hummid making is lack of water a bigger deal than normal. Also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal. In conclusion I temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.	2	2		2																						71	5	75	0	0	0	4.197183098591549	14.2	20	9	8	3	1	5	42	7.2	6.44	7.19	9	6.7	8.25	8.375	7.2	95
4174	6570	3	The features oF the bike ride to Yosemite through California in June affect the cyclist. Some of the features were it was hot high deserts, and no water. This affected the author by making him dehydrated and tired, which made it hard for him to find water or to get to Yosemite. In this cass the outhor says “The sun was beating down on me”. The author is hot From the sun. He says “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. He is showing how he hasno water and is probably dehydrated. All of those features are affecting the way he is traveling and getting to water.	2	2		2																						109	7	117	2	0	0	4.3577981651376145	15.571428571428571	27	17	6	2	5	12	59	5.9	6.89	7.35	15	6.2	8.01	6.125	8.8	151
4175	6571	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.	2	2		2																						163	10	183	6	0	0	4.638036809815951	16.3	45	24	11	16	2	23	85	9.5	8.52	7.44	21	8.0	9.2	7.142857142857142	10.0	229
4177	6573	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways, first is that it is very hot in the desert. Second is that there aren’t many towns out there. Finally is that water is hard to find out there, so if he get thirsty it would be hard to get more water if you didn’t find a town.	1	1		1																						56	3	61	2	0	0	3.857142857142857	18.666666666666668	9	6	8	6	1	7	37	6.1	4.59	6.54	2	5.9	7.48	8.666666666666666	6.4	65
4184	6581	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist is tired and thirsty already. The features include a desert like setting of California, it is extremely hot, there are no signs of civilization in sight, and the roads are like hills that always were throughout the desert. On top of those facts the cyclist is dehydrating because his water suposely has diminished.	1	1		1																						64	3	70	3	0	0	4.96875	21.333333333333332	18	5	3	4	2	7	36	12.6	11.02	8.39	11	10.4	12.27	12.666666666666666	11.2	94
4186	6583	3	Some features of the setting affected the cyclist. The rolling hills, poisonous snake, and the conditions of the road worried her. For example, @CAPS1 said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary.” @CAPS1 had high doubt when saying that quote. @CAPS1 didn't think @CAPS1 would ever make it. Finally, @CAPS1 reached another destination and again finding herself asking another older man for directions!	2	2		2																						77	5	89	6	1	0	5.142857142857143	15.4	21	15	7	4	4	14	36	12.4	11.2	9.31	17	9.6	10.84	11.875	11.7	118

4196	6593	3	The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” Affect the cyclist in many ways. First in the essay when the @CAPS1 says he is in the deserts of California, that can affect because it gives them an idea of how hot it most likely was out there and how lack of water can really harm someone. Also when the @CAPS1 describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply.	2	2		2																						96	3	102	2	0	0	4.177083333333333	32.0	23	11	3	9	3	8	58	14.3	6.98	8.68	13	12.2	13.22	16.666666666666668	7.8	126
4198	6595	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because. It was a lack of the water and he was in the high deserts or California .For example in the text stated “when I tried a drop or two, it  had the flovor of battery acid. That showed clearly when he tried to get water from a pump what it clearly came out as the settling was extremely hot and made the cyclist misreable in such ways.	1	1		1																						76	5	81	1	0	0	4.077922077922078	15.4	18	9	5	4	4	9	44	10.6	6.51	8.63	11	9.6	12.75	14.333333333333334	10.5	100
4204	6601	3	Through most the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way. For instance, he makes it to this town a guy swore was there, but it turned out to be abandoned. So he let out a sad, hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, so he hung his head and that blues tune “summer time” rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst. So he stuck some pepples in his mouth to take his mind off it. Then he thought about how lucky he’d be if he checked, @CAPS1 negative to me.	2	2		2																						113	7	127	7	0	0	4.185840707964601	16.142857142857142	28	15	8	8	3	19	67	6.4	5.91	6.81	11	4.8	7.15	8.0	8.0	141
4205	6602	3	The features from the essay affect the cyclist in many was because he is getting field, and is drinking more and more water. The raods are getting rough so he needs to slow down. If he slows down he will get tierd and need more water although he is all out on top of that the old men really didnt know what they were talking about the features affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						71	3	76	1	0	0	4.126760563380282	23.666666666666668	12	12	6	2	3	6	47	9.9	6.62	7.48	8	9.0	9.48	12.166666666666666	6.4	89

4211	6608	3	The features of this setting effect the author while he is cycling. They changed his hope to doubt. There were no buildings or cars, which led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water. Im sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just civilization, then the cyclist would of been fine.	1	2		2																						69	5	80	5	0	0	4.449275362318841	13.8	14	14	3	7	1	10	45	6.4	7.07	7.07	7	5.1	6.1	6.1	5.7	88
4212	6609	3	Blazing tempitures, lack of water, dwinding hope-all are the parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. Blazing tempitures, because the hotter the water was the more perspiration and lack of hydration was appointment you can’t put anything back in your skin and your body can’t function without water finally dwinding . Hope, the cyclist didn’t think he was going to live through this. He tried hard and pushed himself and success was made.

4220	6617	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The temperature in the area affect the way he drinks his water which leads him to thinking he is going to die because he is running out of water. The “towns” he comes to are so deserted he thinks he is going in the wrong direction. All the settings in the story also help him not to give up but keep on going.

In the end he did make it and all it was worth it.	2	2		2																						114	6	120	0	0	0	3.807017543859649	19.0	16	23	4	4	3	7	77	6.0	4.47	6.8	8	6.0	8.65	10.8	7.8	141
4221	6618	3	There are many setting that affect the cyclist. One feature would be the terrain around him. Also, the obstacles faced by the cyclist. Another feature would be the types of wild animals & scarceness of water around . Also, the old man who gave him unimportant & non-updated information.

4228	6625	3	During the cyclist journey to Yosemite many things got in his way and slowed him down. For example, he listened to the old men who gave him wrong directions to where he wanted to go. Also, his water supply was getting low which drained his energy alot quicker than usual. The heat also played a part of his energy loss. The heat made him sweat perfusely which made the water that was in his body be of no use.	2	1		2																						79	5	86	2	0	0	4.189873417721519	15.8	19	13	6	3	1	8	45	6.2	6.2	7.62	10	5.9	8.35	7.9	8.8	102
4231	6628	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. The landscape was hard to ride on, there was intense heat & little water.

4234	6631	3	Setting that affected the cyclist was water tempeter, rolling hills and condition of the roads. Water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started pumping the water it was hot but he took it he tried to let it cool down but it didn’t. Rolling hills was another a tender to the cyclist hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up his can strain the leg and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition, it was smooth at frist then it became rough and rocky. Those was some affects the cyclist had to over come	2	2		2																						123	6	130	2	0	0	4.2682926829268295	20.5	27	23	8	3	5	7	68	8.9	7.14	7.48	13	7.7	9.18	11.0	8.8	163
4238	6635	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The hills afected the cyclist because they would be harder for him to ride The abandoned town also affected him. When he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break but when he got there the town was abandoned. Also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on. Also there was nowhere that he could get water around him. Many features of the setting affected him.	2	2		2																						90	6	96	0	0	0	4.188888888888889	15.0	14	15	5	5	2	5	62	5.8	6.02	5.96	8	5.6	6.44	6.833333333333333	6.4	114
4246	6643	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, “Sometimes life can be so cruel”. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He’s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						144	7	159	7	0	0	4.284722222222222	20.571428571428573	36	20	10	5	5	18	80	7.7	6.61	7.93	15	6.8	8.31	6.857142857142857	7.6	188
4247	6644	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It made him become dehydrated. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 sentence @NUM2 he stated “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows how the heat and climate of the setting affected him by how he was getting thrown off balance and wears     to him getting dehydrated. The setting of the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, effects the cyclist in the story.	1	1		1																						81	5	89	4	0	0	4.7560975609756095	16.4	22	15	3	1	2	13	39	11.2	9.57	8.93	16	10.0	10.1	11.875	10.7	125
4248	6645	3	The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. It is an extremely hot now in California while the narrator in aiding his ride. This causes him to become delighted much faster while he is on a “Short hit” leading to no where. ”Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from ?? a gorgeous day in June” This gust shows how that calm day really was and the fact the cyclist is sweating so much shows how much the weather is affecting him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling towards up and down no often, it secured his journey. It cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water.The deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply.	2	3		3																						158	11	171	2	0	2	4.408805031446541	14.454545454545455	33	25	8	16	4	15	92	10.8	8.42	8.37	26	9.7	11.76	14.25	10.9	220
4251	6648	3	Each time the author comes to a point where the setting isn’t very appealing or helpful, he loses hope for reaching his destination or finding a nice place to rest and get some fresh water. For example, the text states, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point. This shows that he’s getting frustrated and losing some hope. He also mentions that the “sight was troubling” which shows how big of an affect the features around him or scenery can have.	2	2		2																						109	6	123	6	0	0	4.724770642201835	18.166666666666668	28	16	14	3	6	19	53	9.9	9.05	8.74	18	6.8	9.85	8.666666666666666	9.7	147
4267	6664	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist .The setting makes him feel thirsty, dry, hot, and lost. In the story the setting plays a big party in the cyclist's will to ride to the next town. First the cyclist asks directions from a guy that never left his house in decades this creates, doubt. Also in the story it says “Tumbleweeds cross my path” this makes the cyclists feel lost. Finally it say the “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This makes the cyclist thirsty and tired. The features definatly have an effect on the cyclists.	2	2		2																						99	7	110	4	0	0	4.636363636363637	14.142857142857142	26	17	9	6	2	14	48	8.7	8.58	7.49	12	7.4	8.22	8.083333333333334	8.3	135
4269	6666	3	The cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his ride. First, he was in the “high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 usually brings a picture to my mind of a very dry, hot place. The cyclist had trouble finding water he needed, and thought he might die of heatstroke in the conditions. Also, there were hills. The cyclist said he had to ride over “one long, crippling hill.” From my experiences as a cyclist, hills are the worst part, especially if you’re thirsty. The climate in this story was very hot and dry, and the terrain was full of hills, so altogether, that would make one bad bike ride.	2	2		2																						112	6	128	10	0	0	4.5	18.666666666666668	28	14	12	8	3	20	61	9.1	7.83	7.52	15	7.0	9.62	8.166666666666666	8.8	146
4274	6671	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” By Joe Kurmaskie the settings affected the cyclist by how hard his ride is.

4275	6672	3	Varias faetures of the setting affect the journey and mooble if the cyclist in the text. The first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the desert. He is “traveling through the high deserts of California in June” , and this is making him really thirsty. “[He] had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly “because of this. He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless. He becomes hopelee because there is no building or establishments anywere in sight. Therefore no water and there isn’t a place to get any water. Another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions. They told him abait a shoutcut, and he listened. This through everything off, and he was left with despair. Another feature is the Gary and Wilber’s fish camp.This lead him to sicocss of finding water. This affected his mood because he had hope again. In conlusio, many of the features of the setting affected his mood in many ways.	2	3		3																						168	15	190	5	0	0	4.6923076923076925	11.266666666666667	44	22	7	8	8	30	98	7.9	8.87	7.92	24	6.4	7.48	7.0	9.1	237
4288	6685	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was very hot and he didn’t have any more water also, there aren’t any towns that had good water in them, until he eventually arrived at this fishing comp. Due to his lack of water, he became dehydrated and really weak. “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” this quote shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and losing his energy.	1	2		2																						77	3	84	5	0	0	4.532467532467533	25.666666666666668	13	12	7	4	3	11	47	19.2	9.01	9.03	9	17.1	18.0	23.75	0.0	113
4292	6689	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.

4307	6704	3	The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him. Also the change from “Flat read”, (Kurmaskie) to “short, rolling hills” (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster.

4351	6748	3	Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he’s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old “codgers”  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.” Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.	3	2		3																						158	8	174	1	0	0	4.366459627329193	20.125	41	20	8	10	5	22	91	12.6	7.9	8.64	22	10.0	13.05	18.666666666666668	10.5	213
4357	6754	3	The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June traveling back rodes, with no place to stop for water, if the cyclist would have followed the path they intended on following the ride probably have been more enjoyable and he/she wouldn’t of had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water, they would have been fine.	1	1		1																						61	1	67	3	0	0	4.721311475409836	61.0	14	9	2	2	2	5	38	31.3	10.52	9.77	9	24.7	28.33	37.5	0.0	88
4360	6757	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that said “Rough Road Ahead” he was already low on water, but that made things much worse. The rough road made it harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working harder and getting thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some pebbles on the ground and shoved them in his mouth. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate”. Lastly, “GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP”, could possibly have saved the cyclist’s life. He stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear. The setting and features severly affected the cyclist throughout his journey.	2	2		2																						142	7	157	7	0	0	4.704225352112676	20.285714285714285	35	23	8	16	7	23	71	10.9	9.34	7.98	19	7.7	9.81	13.5	9.6	189
4365	6762	3	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, a cyclist travels through an extreme climate and tough terrain that nearly end his life to get to his destination. After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first “town” the locals said he’d find is deserted. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has “the flavor of battery acid.” With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June”, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” @CAPS1 tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a “water-depleting @NUM3.” eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, knowing now to strike out on better days and better directions.	2	3		3																						187	8	210	12	0	0	4.748663101604278	23.375	55	28	15	12	3	34	91	12.6	9.64	9.02	31	10.1	11.71	8.5	10.1	261
4372	6769	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist thought that the journey he was about to go on was going to be a good one, but that soon changes. For example, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porched since Carter was in office.” This quote tells how at first the cyclist thought his journey was going to be a good one, but getting information from two old men soon changed that.

4375	6772	3	Desert, Hills and road condition and lack of water –all are how the setting affected the cyclist. First, the cyclist reveals he is in the desert when he exclaims, “I was trave ling throug the high deserts of california in June.” This means it was hot. Second the hills and road condition’s were horrible. The cyclist reveals this when he describes, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” aid againg  It read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly, He had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from. So he drank all the rate he wanted. He then figured out the needed to conserve it but by then it was too late. The examples shows that the cyclists condition was harder than he expected them to be.	1	1		1																						137	9	153	6	0	0	4.420289855072464	15.333333333333334	35	21	7	8	4	23	71	8.1	7.48	8.17	21	6.4	8.59	11.0	8.8	178
4377	6774	3	The setting of where the cyclist was, was a californa desert in the middle of June. He thinks hes going to die towards the end because of the directions he got. “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches sinse carter was in office.” This means to never take directions from people who haven’t been to the place for  a while.	1	1		1																						71	4	77	1	0	0	4.416666666666667	18.0	20	11	2	1	0	10	40	17.3	8.77	8.73	8	14.8	15.89	20.25	0.0	97
4381	6778	3	In this @ORGANIZATION1 I will explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the short story “Rough Road A Head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” The whole ordeal occurs in the “high deserts of california.” @CAPS1 to the text the cyclist had taken “out of date” direction from elderly people who thought they new the way.

4390	6787	3	The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe.	2	1		2																						99	6	107	1	0	0	4.212121212121212	16.5	19	21	6	4	5	7	60	6.6	6.44	6.85	10	5.0	7.0	7.416666666666666	5.5	120
4397	6794	3	The setting effected the cyclist because it was bumpy and had a lot of hills which means he has to work harder. Also because of the heat he was getting dehydrated in the story after the cyclist had Been rideing a long time it says “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state “(kurmaskie @NUM1).

4398	6795	3	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist I think is disgardment. First of all, a reason would be because at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist disgards it by going down the hill anyways. Also, it states that it “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.”	1	1		1																						62	3	67	3	0	0	4.274193548387097	20.666666666666668	15	7	3	2	1	8	37	9.0	6.96	6.96	7	7.8	8.93	11.0	7.8	81

4407	6804	3	Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in “do not exceed posted speed limit.” As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the author’s energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of “do not exceed posted speed limit” places the cyclist in a life threatening situation.	3	3		3																						158	6	171	7	0	0	4.943037974683544	26.333333333333332	54	18	10	4	6	19	75	15.0	11.15	9.74	34	12.4	14.82	15.5	13.3	243

4428	6825	3	Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who don’t tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. @PERSON2, “The sun was beginning to beat down… I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer.	3	1		3																						135	6	147	2	0	0	4.330882352941177	22.666666666666668	34	18	11	11	5	17	70	12.6	7.72	8.37	17	10.3	12.58	18.666666666666668	10.4	179

4439	6836	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, your in the desert cycling for many hours very hot and only have limited water. This affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park. Anothe example, is that you are going up and down rolling hills and you legs get very tired so they don’t want to move any more. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you and your sweating so much and @MONTH1 be seeing thing but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																						130	6	138	2	0	0	4.1	21.666666666666668	25	21	8	7	7	8	86	8.7	6.09	7.02	12	8.2	9.91	11.2	9.3	166
4441	6838	3	There are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place. Meaning there was no water any where to be seen in miles. Also towns were nowhere to be seen for it would be hard to substain life out there. This quote supports there weren’t many towns, ''About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town.''This shows there aren't many towns in these parts, @CAPS1 so hot and thirsty as the text claims, ''I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst ''this clearly shows the  man wa very thirsty. Also shows the man was very thirsty. Also @CAPS1 so hot out there the man could see visions as the text states, ''As the looks ofter had been a grape juice factory and bottling plant.'' why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of no where. Therefore these statements above show how settings can affect ones mind and physical conditions to the cyclist.	2	2		2																						177	10	199	4	0	0	4.385474860335195	17.9	45	23	13	20	4	19	104	10.5	7.49	8.3	19	7.2	9.52	10.2	7.6	218
4455	6852	3	The cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” was riding through the California dessert in June. This dry, bare setting made it impossible to find any source of water. The only time that this cyclist found water was when it @NUM1 and tasting of battery acid. There was nowhere for him to find water for miles. This lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily. He even says that he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone. By taking the advise of the old men and taking a “short cut”, the cyclist past through ghost towns with no water. This “short cut” prolonged his trip, most likely by hours If he had gone through populated area despite the fact that it is a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would allow him to go faster. The dry, hot setting of the old men’s “short cut” made this cyclist’s trip last much longer than nessiarry.	3	2		3																						167	9	182	6	0	0	4.311377245508982	18.555555555555557	48	22	12	10	4	21	86	8.2	7.14	7.68	15	5.8	8.16	6.428571428571429	6.9	208
4457	6854	3	When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships.	2	2		2																						144	9	164	5	0	0	5.118055555555555	16.0	41	19	10	6	5	21	79	11.7	11.25	8.7	30	9.1	11.09	10.5	11.2	222
4465	6862	3	The cyclist was in California in June, the sun was beating down on him this made the ride difficult with short water supply The man came upon several towns that were abandond which made his water supply less. The terrain was long and straight then turned into tall hills which had to be difficult to ride.	1	2		2																						56	3	59	1	0	0	4.464285714285714	18.666666666666668	14	7	7	2	1	4	32	13.6	8.59	7.56	6	10.7	12.63	16.0	0.0	75

There is also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around this bars the cyclists hope of finding civilization. Also not seeing any building and when he sees are it being deserted makes this very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he @CAPS1 the pump that has tar, dirt, then hot water in it. Also the road plays a toll on him.

For example, A tarlike substance oozed followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This affects him because cant get water from the well. So this means he needs water, but cannot get water. Also in the essay it says the terrain is bad so that means that the cyclist has to pedal harder to keep moving and he has to work harder to hot reek. So all this puts affect on him from just whats around him. The old abbandon factory with the boy drinking juice was had the  most effect on the cyclist because he was so thirsty and that was when he was about to give up.

4484	6881	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The speaker tells us that he’s riding his bike in the middle of the desert in June. This shows the author is probably very hot. The author tells us that the road turned into hills and bumps. This would make it more difficult for the author because he would have to use more energy to move up the hill. And lastly, the cyclist tells us that the “towns” he came to were abandoned and uncared for. This would not be good for the cyclist because he would be able to get water for his trip.	2	2		2																						112	7	120	1	0	0	4.178571428571429	16.0	24	17	6	5	3	12	67	6.3	6.26	7.25	11	6.0	7.83	6.714285714285714	7.4	142

For example If some one was riding a bike in warm wheather on flat land it would not take major determination to pedal.

4507	6904	3	“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from “old timers” the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that’s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn’t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn’t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn’t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through.	3	3		3																						207	11	223	5	0	0	4.777777777777778	18.818181818181817	50	30	14	18	3	29	110	11.4	9.92	8.63	34	10.2	11.18	11.8	11.2	301
4520	6918	3	In the story “Rough Road ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” a cyclist is faced with many problems. It’s really hot out, practically a desert and its in June. Just knowing that makes me want some water. Also this cyclist is running short of water and still hasn’t got to the place he needs to be. The roads are hills and bumpy which make it harder for him. Those are the problems this cyclist is faced with.	1	1		1																						78	6	86	1	0	0	4.294871794871795	13.0	19	11	4	7	3	12	43	5.3	6.13	7.72	8	4.8	5.71	5.833333333333333	6.4	99

4524	6922	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of @LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has almost no water left. This lack of water makes the cyclist desperate for food and water. The setting has a lot to do with how the cyclist reacts to what happens.	1	1		1																						60	5	65	0	0	0	4.3	12.0	18	7	3	1	3	5	35	4.8	6.19	7.13	7	4.4	6.13	5.4	6.7	80
4525	6923	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, because there was no one in sight he couldn’t ask for any help or direction. Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didn’t help him it just tired him more. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have biten him and then he wouldn’t be able to make it anywhere because of the bite. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																						119	6	128	3	0	0	4.260504201680672	19.833333333333332	21	13	7	9	4	12	81	8.5	6.96	6.87	8	7.5	8.93	11.0	8.8	152
4540	6938	3	The setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way. “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town” (Kurmaskie). The cyclist put the words towns in to parentasis because it was actually a Ghost town. no on lived there, It was abandoned. Around the cyclist was deserts, and more empty towns. The father the cyclist got, the more we realized the old men were wrong as the cyclest was running low on water and there was no where to stop. He finally found some and vowed to never listen to old mens directions again.	2	2		2																						99	7	112	4	0	0	4.444444444444445	14.142857142857142	23	13	6	10	3	15	57	9.4	7.72	7.65	10	7.5	9.94	11.1	9.4	130

The cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate  through the ""hills"" as opposed to the ""Flat roads,"" making him more quickly tired. The speaker states, “I could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a ‘heatstroke’ which could slow him down. The speaker also states,""water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees""(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated.

4561	6959	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was died tried he/she didn’t have anything to drink. The essay stated how would say she/he would save the water til the end. He /she was so tired so the lack of water really affect him/her. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions.	2	2		2																						146	12	175	3	0	0	4.609589041095891	12.166666666666666	39	19	7	6	4	17	91	6.4	7.64	6.4	13	5.7	6.25	5.666666666666667	9.7	210

4565	6963	3	Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no.	1	2		2																						95	8	105	2	0	0	4.326315789473684	11.875	21	18	11	3	1	10	52	4.9	6.31	7.55	13	4.4	6.02	5.3125	6.6	121
4572	6970	3	The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers so that he could take a short cut. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert. It says in the text “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid” This shows that he had no water left to kept him dehydrated throughout his travel. Also in the text it says “with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” this shows that he had no energy left.	2	2		2																						140	9	150	3	0	0	4.335714285714285	15.555555555555555	29	25	9	3	3	14	82	9.0	7.43	7.45	18	7.6	10.57	9.0	11.2	187

This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at.

4581	6979	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many features of the setting affected the cyclist. And these setting could be easily formed in the middle part of the essay. And these settings caused the cyclist exsaused on his journey. First, the cyclist noticed a rode change from flat to short, rolling hills. He had to spend more energy to go up the hills which caused him to loss a certain amount of  energy. Then, his lack of water caused him a dehydrated state. He could loss an another large amount of energy by this and out of this stage, he mostly needs someone to support him or be on his side, but he was riding alone, there was no one on sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. This might cause his emotion break down to make his energy to loss. Overall, the cyclist suffered a loss of energy on his journey.

4593	6991	3	In the essay I can conclude that there were many features of the land that affected the cyclist. For example in the text it states “ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” If you are greatly afraid of snakes that could ruin your whole trip. The cyclist was scared but over came the fear and moved on. Also another thing that changed the cyclist was the lack of water. Not having enough water could be bad. As stated “I could drop from heatstore on a gorgeous day in June…” There are many features that effected the cyclist and his journey.	1	1		1																						107	8	115	0	0	0	4.348623853211009	13.625	27	14	9	5	4	12	61	8.4	7.71	7.62	14	6.7	8.99	8.166666666666666	8.8	137

4629	7027	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn’t so hot, then he wouldn’t of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn’t help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																						154	13	175	8	0	0	4.259740259740259	11.846153846153847	35	21	14	11	1	24	93	4.6	5.73	6.99	17	4.4	7.06	5.0	8.4	199
4634	7032	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in many ways, if it were hot out, he would be thirsty and sweaty. If there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty. The cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town. The cyclist said” I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine,” By saying this, he knows that he can make it that far as well as determined to do so. With the terrain causing even more trouble for him, would make it more difficult, but he knows that he must overcome his challenging activity but he still keeps a strong spirit with that, he can do just about anything because he has the encouragement he needs.	2	2		2																						143	5	156	9	0	0	4.265734265734266	28.6	19	21	13	12	5	16	98	13.0	7.5	7.59	15	9.7	12.84	10.4	9.4	178
4663	7061	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. The harsh turane proved a challenge when his water supply was low and all towns had been abandoned leaving him no refill. The heat was also a factor quickly creating him weary and tired. On the bike ride he had a glimmer of hope at an old water pump but quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted of battery acid. The setting set the conflict and helped achive the tone the author was looking for to affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						86	5	91	0	0	0	4.453488372093023	17.2	24	13	7	3	4	5	41	8.1	7.94	8.9	17	7.6	7.81	8.0	6.7	117
4673	7071	3	The hot wheather is dehydrating the cyclist, who can’t find more water. The hills are rough terrain is draining the energy he has.

4688	7086	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For example when he was riding on the road he would pick a destination and ride to it. Then he would take a break.

If it looked like their was nothing ahead but hills, he would just ride and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world.	1	1		1																						72	5	78	1	0	0	4.25	14.4	12	10	2	5	4	6	45	5.8	6.31	6.54	7	5.4	7.98	7.199999999999999	8.8	92

But then he started to think he might die, but he wasnt sad or upset, he was happy. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the fact that he might die because he listend to some old men.

He passes “ghost towns,” “abandoned buildings,” and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of “dropping” dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing “what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy."" He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men.

The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture.

Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it wouldve made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle @MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn’t. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn’t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It’s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it.	2	3		3																						168	9	193	13	0	0	4.4523809523809526	18.666666666666668	36	25	15	14	6	27	100	8.9	7.66	8.32	24	7.0	10.1	8.333333333333334	9.7	226

4746	7144	3	The setting affects the cyclist mood in the story the cyclist takes a short cut with many abandon towns, and buildings as well as a bumpy, terrain. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump he immediately began to pump it the water was not good for drinking. He was determined to make it to the next town. “I could make that” he said. Because of the ghost town and the old pump he had to continue on. When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road a hed he began to get depressed, “I was sad”. Finally when he reached @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 Fish Camp he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain. At the end when the setting is bright so is his mood.	2	3		3																						168	8	180	3	0	0	3.982142857142857	21.0	43	21	14	6	6	16	98	7.8	5.34	7.03	16	6.8	9.35	10.6	8.1	209

4761	7159	3	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn’t have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated.	3	3		3																						147	9	165	10	0	0	4.448979591836735	16.333333333333332	42	16	10	5	4	23	84	8.7	7.78	7.99	18	8.1	9.26	8.333333333333334	9.8	199

For example, the features at the setting was disturb the cyclist to ride in road because it tells them where they can go and where they can’t and they shouldn’t do this or that such as the sign of “no entering” or “one way”. Second, it’s limite their speed because if the features of the setting it said the limited speed is @NUM1, the cyclist only can ride about @NUM1 and go no more further which can make the cyclist longer time to reach the place that they want to go and couldn’t travel faster. Third, it make their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or how fast they can rode. Such as the sign of “Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit”.

The cyclist had started out with confidence, followed by determination, then relief. The setting affected the cyclist physically and mentally. First, listening to the old men was stupid, then taking the trip not certain if you would have enough water, and lastly traveling through the desert in June. He started getting a little doubtful with himself as well, that won’t help much with bringing success of the trip. Once he had made it to a fish camp an old man even older then the men who gave him the false information told him he knew how to get to Yosemite, but the young man did the best thing and told him he already knew how to get there. He didn’t need to be traveling out in the desert heat for hours that’s just unhealthy	2	2		2																						154	7	167	7	0	0	4.5064935064935066	22.0	32	25	14	13	4	16	86	10.8	8.36	8.01	23	8.3	11.4	8.833333333333334	10.3	206
4767	7165	3	A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting. One feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard times on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling ??? know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks  on us. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature.	3	2		3																						152	9	168	4	0	3	4.431372549019608	17.0	41	18	11	6	1	16	87	10.5	8.07	7.95	23	9.4	11.29	11.8	10.6	214
4770	7168	3	In the story the cyclisst had ran out of water. He had mentioned it tasted like battery acid. The surroundings affected him by looking around and not seeing anybody around for miles.

The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation that means there is no water so he was becoming dehydrated. Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldn’t quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasn’t been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welch’s juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved.

8889	14839	6	soon after it's conception, The Empire State Building mooring mast was doomed to fail. Early obstacles were easily surmounted, for example the problem of added stress on the building's frame caused by the added weight of the moored airship. This was fixed by structural modifications to the building's frame, an expensive but fairly simple procedure. one of the biggest blows to the project was the advent of the Hindenburg disaster. The Hindenburg disaster was the cause of the forefront of a decline in airships. Airplanes became a safer, faster, more designer form of transportation. In addition to the Hindenburg disaster, it soon became clear that mooring and airship at @NUM1'or higher was not feasible. Surging winds would not allow the airship to maintain it's course and the ship would be blown erratically around the mast. The final nail in the coffin for the mooring mast was a law prohibiting airship travel over urban areas. These multiple factors easily disallowed any possibility of successful airship travel in the future.	4	3		4																						168	10	188	6	0	0	5.184523809523809	16.8	56	16	15	7	3	17	81	12.3	12.01	9.83	42	10.6	12.24	11.166666666666666	12.7	262

To make the Empire State building bigger than the Chrysler building, Smith was going to construct somthing that John Tauranac stated, ""Would be equipped for an age of transportation that was only the dream of aviation pioneers"". That dream was to travel by blimp. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for the dock of air ships. It was not going to be as easy as the concept. The architects couldn't drop a mooring mass on the roof because it would stress the buildings frame. The greatest reason the mast would never fufill its destiny was for safety.

First, in order for the building to accommodate the stress that the dirigibles would add to the building's frame, the framework of the building had to be modified. This cost over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen-a highly flammable gas. An accident could be fatal in a densely-populated area like New York City. Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building that would making docking difficult and could possibly blow a dirigible into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying to low over urban areas; it would be illegal for a ship even to approach the building's area.	3	3		3																						144	7	165	7	0	0	5.0	20.571428571428573	41	20	10	9	2	17	76	12.4	10.97	9.48	34	11.3	12.96	10.666666666666666	13.0	225
8927	14877	6	The builders had a very hard time because of where it was located, and how the dirigible was to dock. Their first problem was the fact that it was so tall, it was hard to work on. Another problem was the fact that the blimp would be pulling in on the building, so it had to be reinforced. The final problems that made them most an unreliable choice, were the wind conditions and the fact that the tail end of the blimp could swing freely.

By adding the mast lots of stress would be added to the buildings frame and therefore strengthening modifications had to take place before the mast was erected. Another problem was how to tether the Blimp properly since they are generally landed in wide open fields which allowed for wieghts to be place in the front and back of the blimp, they could be secured properly. But since the blimp was going to be attached to a mast, there was no way to secure the back of the blimp and therefore no safe way to tie the blimp down. And finally the last problem builders faced was the how to even get the blimp docked. Since there was such high winds on top of the building there was no feasible way to dock the blimp in less it was perfect weather. Ultimately all those problems made it so the mast could never be used.	3	3		3																						177	8	188	3	0	0	4.446327683615819	22.125	40	27	10	11	5	12	110	10.6	8.12	7.77	23	8.4	11.1	12.0	10.4	232

Because, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the dirigible and wind pressure. Next, safety became an issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigible's built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"", owners of the Empire State Building realized the hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An addition problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigibles back end swivel around the mooring mast, seeing as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2, it would be illegal for a Ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area.

The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float eayser. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obsticle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible. The third obsticle faced was there was a law agianst it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law.

The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury."	3	3		3																						223	10	240	3	0	0	4.6591928251121075	22.3	60	25	15	14	1	18	127	11.7	9.52	7.93	34	9.6	11.25	10.333333333333334	11.4	314

In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Al Smith and other architectural builders faced many problems. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Also, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Both of these obstacles were reasons that explain the failure of the mooring mast. The builders were not successful at their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																						117	6	129	6	0	0	5.196581196581197	19.5	38	18	7	6	1	12	55	12.8	12.18	9.33	25	9.7	11.22	12.2	11.5	179

9159	15109	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders faced while attempting to build the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building were: finding a way to make this building bigger than the Chrysler Building, Designing the mast and @CAPS1 the reality. Al Smith needed a way to make is building bigger than the Chrysler building. He came up with the idea with putting a mooring mast on the building. The idea seemed great. While designing the mast, architects realized they can't just place the mast right on top of the building. They'd have to modify the foundation. After changing the skeleton of the building, construction went on as planned. Two month later the mast was finished, but the architects forgot that most dirigibles use hydrogen which is highly flammable. All the work the architects put in was for nothing because the mooring mast was never used.	2	2		2																						146	9	163	5	0	0	4.890410958904109	16.22222222222222	42	26	6	5	2	13	79	9.7	10.09	7.9	23	7.2	9.77	7.571428571428571	10.5	206
9164	15114	6	Some problems that the builders faced building the mast on the top of the building was that the builders couldn't just drop the mast on top of the building's flat roof because then the wind would cause stress to the frame because the blimps could hanging there. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to make the mast. The cost for these modifications were another problem for them two.	2	2		2																						75	3	80	0	0	0	4.64	25.0	21	9	1	3	1	3	50	12.9	9.52	7.19	7	9.5	11.07	13.5	8.8	94

9204	15154	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirig ibles to dock there. One problem was strengthening the building's frame. This was necessary because the added pressure of the dirigible's load and wind  needed to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation. The existing skeleton of the building had to be edited. In fact, these edits cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem builders faced was constructing the mast itself. To give it a unique look, architects made the tower out of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. They had to place the machinery at the base of this tower. The builders also had to make sure it was accessible to passengers; they made sure luggage and people could go to and from the aircraft. These are two of the challenges builders faced is constructing the Empire State Building. Despite the mast being unused in the present day, the design makes this building one of the most well-known buildings in the world.	2	1		2																						169	11	191	3	0	0	4.9	15.454545454545455	49	27	9	5	4	21	95	9.4	10.03	7.86	29	6.9	8.76	6.625	9.8	238

Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to paragraph @NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of @ORGANIZATION2 where pedestrians could be harmed. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So in theory, all of the plans the builders of this concoction had to be put to rest due to the governments law.

9213	15163	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, while trying to build a dock for dirigible. One problem was safety. While American dirigibles used helium, other countries filled their dirigibles with highly flamable helium. If a dirigible were to ignite in a heavily populated area like New York City, the result would be deadly. Nature also caused problems with the mooring mast. The winds above the building were too strong and ever-changing, and could potentially destroy the dirigibles. Finally, federal laws stated that an air craft could not dock that close to a building.

The winds at the top of the building, too, created danger, for they constantly shifted from the violent air currents.

Dirigibles normally dropped lead weights to secure there landings, but this would be impractical when people were on the streets below. Wind was also a major problem because it made the blimp difficult to stabilize in the air. The wind would be ever more problematic in the city as if a Dirigible hit a building it would puncture and fall into New York city.

9252	15202	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was safety because outside the U.S dirigibles were using hydrogen instead of helium which is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. One more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law said it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building.	3	2		3																						98	6	104	0	0	0	4.826530612244898	16.333333333333332	29	11	7	7	1	7	49	9.5	10.03	9.44	24	8.5	11.01	10.5	11.9	150
9256	15206	6	One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Because of the violent air currents the winds were constantly shifting. The dirigible would constantly be moving around. They couldn't even weigh it down, because there would be people far below them, and they could fall. A second obstacle they faced were the laws against it. There were existing laws about airships flying too low over the city. It was illegal for the airships to even come into the city.           Those two obstacles stop them using the dock for dirigibles.	3	3		2																						90	8	102	2	0	0	4.868131868131868	11.375	17	12	4	8	1	10	56	7.7	9.03	7.08	13	7.1	8.72	5.875	10.0	136

9271	15221	6	The idea of dirigibles being able to dock at such an altitude to begin with was foolish. First off trying to tie a thousand-foot dirigible to a building by a single tether adds huge stress to the building's frame. They were able to fix that problem, but the main issue they couldn't fix was mother nature. The wind speed at that height is incredibly violent and would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast.

9283	15233	6	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the building of the Empire State Building had many obstacles the builders had to overcome. Some practical obstacles in building this landmark was the law against airships flying low, the complete dirigible mooring equipment wasn't installed, and greatest obstacle of all was nature surrounding the Empire State Building.The first obstacle builders had to overcome is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The problem with flying too low is the dirigibles couldn't even try to attempt to reach the building. In December 1930, one dirigable approached the mast, but couldn't get close enough fearing the forceful winds would cause it to run into the sharp spires. As if that wasn't a problem, the dirigible mooring equipment wasn't even installed which meant the newspapers being delivered would have to be caught by dangling ropes from the dirigable, which could get tiring. The greatest obstacle of all was nature. Winds at the top of the building were really strong due to the violent wind currents, which could cause the dirigable to keep moving, even when tied up to the mast.Overall, the nature of weather was the huge obstacle.	3	3		3																						196	9	223	11	0	0	5.0353535353535355	22.0	48	31	20	10	2	19	110	16.5	11.78	8.25	33	13.0	13.24	15.0	12.8	289

9356	15306	6	On @DATE1, The Empire State Building was announced to reach the height of 1,250 feet. Al Smith, the architect of the building mentioned that the top would be more than ornamental. It was said that this amazing dream would come true for aviation pioneers. The building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships called dirigibles, otherwise known as blimps. This was thought out to be a great idea. Things didn't quite turn out as originally planned, and Fate struck. As fate struck, things should have been more apparent before it  was ever constructed. Resons being; Most blimbs from outside the states run on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is more flammable. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the dirigible to swivel, and it would be a disaster for anything to happen to New York City and the pedestrians it holds. Another law was the law of how close airships can be to the building. Thus, still leaving the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, but never completing the original goal.	3	3		3																						183	11	207	12	0	0	4.766304347826087	16.727272727272727	49	24	12	12	5	26	100	9.5	9.34	8.26	26	7.4	10.14	7.2857142857142865	10.6	254

Another tough obstacle that would be hard to avoid, was nature in general, like the author mentioned. The winds currents at the top of the building were sporadic, and that could be a huge problem the dirigibles trying to dock. However, the biggest obstacle that builders never realized, was that it was even illegal. The height of the empire State Building was too low for an aircraft of any sort dock on.

The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents, another threat that the builders did not want to risk. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas.

Some of their problems included, the structure of the building, the wind and weather conditions, and the safety of their passengers. The stell frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The building now consisted of 102 floors and contained a stainless steel skeleton. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and would need lead weights to hold it down. This was clearly considered unsafe. Finally the safety of the passengers, was at stake because the complete dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Also, There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the reasons why dirigibles never moored on the Empire State Building due to the many obstacles.	3	3		3																						161	10	176	5	0	0	5.105590062111801	16.1	47	21	10	11	6	16	84	10.7	11.48	8.95	37	8.4	10.42	10.5	11.2	243

9538	15488	6	There were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had to face. One obstacle being constructing a strong enough frame for the building so that a thousand foot derigible could be held by the single tether cable. Another obstacle that builders of the empire state building faced was safety how most derigibles from outside the U.S at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which made it very dangerous since hydrogen is very flammable. This made the constructors have to find a way of creating a landing field where the blimp would not touch any of the sharp spires above the empire state building. These were @NUM1 of the many obstacles that the builders of the empire state were faced with.	3	3		3																						124	5	130	1	0	0	4.782258064516129	24.8	36	14	10	3	0	10	71	13.5	10.39	7.54	13	10.6	12.82	15.75	12.7	170
9545	15495	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building. Lastly, there was already a law in place that prevented dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, which would make it illegal to @CAPS1 or fly a ship in New York City.	4	4		4																						255	11	276	10	0	0	4.607843137254902	23.181818181818183	64	25	25	16	5	20	142	11.9	9.29	7.77	34	9.9	11.76	10.166666666666666	12.1	367
9547	15497	6	Durining the @DATE1 and the 1930s, there was a fierce competition arising over constructing the largest building. To set the Empire State Building apart from the @ORGANIZATION1 decided to put a mooring mask for dirigibles. This would have both meaning and make the Empire State Building the worlds largest building. The mooring mask was certin to fail for a few reasons. For one, forign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flamable and would cause a huge fire @CAPS1. Another reason is above the Empire State Building there are strong winds and currents that are constantely shifting. This would make it very difficult to control the dirigible. Pilots unable to control the dirigible would have great difficulty @CAPS2 their dirigible. Lastly the mooring dock failed because of the law. This law stated that it is illegal to fly air ships to low over urban areas. On 1931 @CAPS3 Clavan @CAPS4 the @CAPS5 of the mooring mask.

9557	15507	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that dirigibles contain highly flammable gases. If the blimp was docked over a large city like New York City, it would be very dangerous if a blimp did catch on fire. Another obstacle was that the docking system would not work as well as planned, nor would it be safe. These airships are at the mercy of the winds and weather. In normal cases of docking dirigibles on open landing fields, they are weighted down on the front and back. If the blimps were to stay in place on the Empire State Building, they would need to have a weight on the back as well as the front, which would end up dangling over the city. Without the weight on the back, the blimp would spin around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which the dirigibles would have to be would not be safe. If the blimp were to the blown by the wind, the blimp would crash into the pointy tops of nearby buildings. These are the obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																						208	11	227	8	0	0	4.4326923076923075	18.90909090909091	57	24	10	8	3	18	122	8.9	7.89	7.15	20	7.1	8.33	8.833333333333334	9.3	267

Mainly because it's only held by a single tether, and because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Another @CAPS1 is that the wind speeds were so much greater in the top of the building that it pushed the dirigibles away from the docking station. Also, most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to stay aloft, and hydrogen is extremely flammable.

9596	15546	6	The builders faced many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.

In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of @MONEY1.  After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable.  After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City.  Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air.  The law also hindered Al Smith's idea.  The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas.  When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings.  The idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes.	3	3		3																						196	11	223	5	0	0	4.597087378640777	18.727272727272727	54	26	21	11	2	16	99	99.1	11.11	16.98	34	78.6	80.85	8.833333333333334	0.0	293

So Al Smith came up with an idea to make a landing dock on top of the Empire State Building for the dirigibles. The government had to go over Al Smith's plan to make sure it was safe and would work. Al Smith's plan was to have the dirigibles hang onto the building by a single tether wire. It wouldnt be alowed because the dirigibles hanging from the wire would cause to much stress to the building. It was also not possible to have dirigibles to land on the Empire State building because the hydrogen and the dirigibles would be a safety hazard.

The mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building would be used to dock one-thousand foot dirigibles; the future of travel. In theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. Another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used. One lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. The soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area.The men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. At the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have rapped the dirigible around the mast. The greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the Empire State Building's history, one blimp has attempted to simulated dock, and another has performed a newspaper stunt.

With the winds blowing and the blimp not securely tethered, and not weighted, Dirigibles would have swayed and moved around. That creates the risk of the blimp getting punctured by sharp edges on other buildings. Also if the blimp ever successfully moored it would create tremendous stress on the building. Besides the technical issues there were some obvious obstacles that oddly never got considered or addressed. The first being a law prohibiting low-altitude flights of airships over urban centers. That makes it illegal to even attempt to land, meaning there was never any remote chance of the mooring mast functioning. The second promblem was, the proper mooring equipment were never installed. That meant no attempt could ever succeed. The builders faced many obstacles building the mast but they're biggest obstacle was lack of preparation, failure to address obvious problems.	4	3		3																						215	14	241	8	0	0	5.26046511627907	15.357142857142858	56	28	25	14	6	28	110	11.0	12.0	9.69	54	8.1	9.51	7.428571428571429	10.1	323

Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible to get close enough like in @DATE1 when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but couldn't get close enough. Another issue with safety. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated.

""The steel frame of the [building] would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate [the added pressure from the dirigible]."" The dirigible's weight was not the only thing that put stress on the building, the wind pressure would also.

An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flamibility. And since the dirrigible is so close to people, such as tourist on the building's observation deck, the dirrigible catching on fire (if it's filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be more disastrous than if it landed in an open field. Lastly,  the dirigibleis so close to urban areas that it is illegal for such airships to dock or even fly at such proximity.  For example, when the Los Angeles tested  the docking process to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.""

Plus when you attempt this you are above crowded New York streets. If there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives. Its much easier lending dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, your planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesnt move around. Yet landing in open fields is dangerous because on @DATE1 in @LOCATION2, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This example shows how that if that were to happen in mid-air over a crowded New York City street or block then many more casualties would have been recorded.

9990	15940	6	When Al Smith first had his idea to build a mast on which to dock dirigibles, it started out as friendly competition. However, nobody predicted the obstacles that would be encountered while trying to execute the plan. One of these obstacles was simply that it was unsafe. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. If there was an accident the results would be devastating in places populated as New York City. Another obstacle was the wind. The wind currents at the top of the building shifted constantly, making the dirigible swing from side to side, which was dangerous for passengers. One more obstacle was the fact that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying below a certain height in cities. Clearly, many obstacles were encountered, and the mast never ended up serving its intended purpose.	3	3		3																						137	9	153	7	0	0	4.985401459854015	15.222222222222221	36	19	10	8	1	16	78	9.7	10.37	8.31	28	8.0	10.46	8.857142857142858	12.5	212

An example of one of their problems is that dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, which makes it very flammable. If the dirigible had an accident over New York many people would be hurt. Another factor that goes with this is the wind currents. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still but if they fell it would hurt some pedestrians walking by. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building.

Because the building was not originally designed to hold down dirigibles, the frame was not sturdy enough to survive the pulling and moving of the blimp in the air. The dirigibles would also be vacillating in the high and unpredictable winds at the top of the building, which was 102 storeys. Aside from pulling loose or damaging the building itself, the dirigibles were in danger of being punctured by another building's spire. Damage to the dirigible in any way was a very dangerous possibility, as the area in New York City around the Empire State Building is densely populated. If the dirigible were to catch fire and blowup, such as the case with the German Hindenburg blimp, many pedestrians or other structures could be seriously damaged. This kind of catastrophe was also probable because of the flammable gases like hydrogen used to keep the blimps afloat. Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems with the U.S. government, whose laws forbid airships to come that close to urban areas like @ORGANIZATION2. It would be illegal for a dirigible to fly near enough to the building to moor to it.

The first problem they had, was that a thousand ton dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The designers had to spend @MONEY1 to reinforce the building's frameworks. This first obstacle already put doubt into the builders minds, that this was not going to happen easily. The next thing they realized, was that with hydrogen dirigibles is that they were extremely flamable. If a huge dirigible were to catch fire and fall onto New York City it would be cataustrophic. This also leasoned their enthusiasm about the work, knowing about how great a risk this would be. The wind above the building were constantly Shifting due to air currents, and this would toss and turn the dirigible tethered to the mast. The designers relized this would be neither practical or safe being over pedestrians on the ground. The last obstacle of all, that really killed their mooring idea, was airship laws. The law states that the dirigibles cannot fly that low over urban areas, so that puts an illegal mark on their plans. The designers of the mooring mast had to face many obstacles in their design, and it was these obstacles that led to the never useing of their mast.	3	4		4																						236	13	261	10	0	0	4.838983050847458	18.153846153846153	62	30	17	10	6	25	134	10.4	9.86	7.75	38	8.0	10.5	8.285714285714286	11.8	341

One of these obstacles they faced was height, and the lack of safety that arose from it.  In @DATE1, the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", which use a highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in New Jersey as described in paragraph thirteen.  Should this have happened to a dirigible docked high over New York City, the airship would plummet to to the ground where many New @CAPS1 would be going about about their day.  The largest obstacle they faced though was nature.  Air currents and storms would cause the dirigible, only teathered to the mooring mast by a rope, to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street.""  As pointed out in paragraph fourteen, this was neither practical, nor say if.  The third obstacle they faced with a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas.  Even as tall as the Empire State Building is, it was still impossible to legally dock at the new mooring mast.  Al Smith's idea finally had to be abandoned due to safety, nature, and state law."	3	4		4																						194	10	233	12	0	0	4.763546798029557	20.3	52	23	19	15	5	29	101	98.8	11.57	16.92	33	77.8	80.07	9.0	0.0	282

It is apparent from very early into the constructions that this was surreal because ""the one obstacle to their expanded life in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (paragraph 6). Having dirigibles cruising through a large city should have been perceivably impossible to Al Smith, even before the construction of the building occurred.

10117	16067	6	When constructing the mooring mast on top of the empire state building it seemed as if the engineers looked past all of its flaws. Safety was probaly one of the biggest issue for the mooring mast. It was said most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen of helium. Thus causing a higher risk to explode. After the events of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they were very afraid what would happen if it occured above downtown Nature was belived to be its biggest obstacle. Winds at the top of the air awalys shifted violently due to air currents. The back of the ships would swivel around and around the mooring mast @CAPS1 were another major reason. Dirigibles were not allowed to fly a certain height over Urban areas. Making it illegal to even approach the area where the building was. Al Smith really should have done some more studying about what could have gone wrong with his mooring mast.	3	3		3																						161	10	173	2	0	0	4.6894409937888195	16.1	48	19	11	6	1	14	88	8.7	9.16	8.65	30	7.2	8.92	8.833333333333334	9.6	226
10118	16068	6	The builders of the Empire state Building faced numerous technical and safety problems in creating the building's dirigible mooring mast. First off, a dirigible moored to the mast by just one cable would put enormous stress to the frame of the building The building's frame had to be strengthened first to allow such a project. When the mast was finished, several other problems prevented its use. The mast was designed to make the building a center of travel, but most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen to fly, instead of helium. Earlier, the German blimp Hindenburg had been destroyed because hydrogen was so flammable. It was realized that such a disaster would be much more catastrophic should it happen over a densely populated city like New York. Also, blimps moored to the mast would be blown around by violent winds, possibly pushing them into nearby buildings. The lead weights normally used to prevent this would have had to be left dangling over pedestrians, a major safety issue- @CAPS1, there was a law prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban settlements, making use of the mast illegal. These problems doomed the mooring mast project from the start.	4	4		4																						197	10	218	10	0	0	5.040609137055838	19.7	54	30	17	16	2	20	101	13.3	11.26	9.21	43	10.7	13.02	12.4	12.7	296
10123	16073	6	After reading excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, the lack of a suitable landing area. The builders knew they had to add a mooring mast to the top of it so it could safely land and passengers could board and exit off. Another problem they faced was placing a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would at stress to the buildings frame. This pressure along with the wind pressure would have to be converted all the way to the buildings foundation. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, allowing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Although was a bright idea to improve transportation, this product never worked and was not thought out properly.	2	3		3																						150	8	166	6	0	0	4.84	18.75	42	22	6	6	3	15	84	10.7	10.21	8.67	32	8.3	10.99	11.8	11.0	213

The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For example, in the excerpt it said that the U.S. navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also the captain could not even take his hands off the lever. The next obstacle they faced was the safety issue. The builders of said the dirigibles are weighted down by lead but if they did that it would be a safety issue.

The problem with that is they used hydrogen instead of helium, causing them to be highly flammable. They thought about when the German dirigible crashed and realized how much worse it would be if it happened in downtown New York. Another issue being nature's wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was always aggresively shifting. Plus using lead weights like they do when landing in the fields would be hazard for the people below. Finally the law was a issue. The law stated that it was illegal to fly this low over urban areas.

These obstacles were what was in the dirigbles, the ""nature"" of winds around New York, and a new law passed on restrictions of airships.     Dirigbles unlike balloons, which are made up of Helium, dirigbles are made up of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamible. This coud have resulted in terrible way if anything caught on fire since New York is so highly densed.     Another problem they faced were the high winds of New York. They were constantly shifting, so they thought to tie the dirigibles down with lead but this would be a bad idea because if the lead ever fell it would injure many people.     Lastly, they recently passed a law against airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law was very strict than the dirigibles wouldnt be allowed to dock there because it might be too close to the city.

The sad truth is that it never happened. According to the article ""The Mooring Mast"", the environmental conditions as well as safety condition, were too poor to accommodate. Apprently, the wind currents at such a high altitude are fears, and if a blimp were to be tethered to the top, quite a great deal of strain would be placed on the building frame. This is time-consuming and costly to fix. Also, there would be no practical way to weigh down the baloon without the risk of the falling on civilians.

The first major obstacle that the builders came upon was that when a dirigible was mounted onto the mooring ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This obstacle caused the need for an abundance of extra support on the frame needed to maintain sturdiness of the building.

This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring.

The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Winds in New York would also make it difficult to land. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.

To begin, they needed to research and engineer a safe and practical way for the dirigible to dock. This was soon done with the help of navy and government research. The next struggle was the structure of the building. Adding a mast with the added weight of the dirigibles and an engine room at the top of the sky scraper would effect the frame. In order for the building to be structurely sound, the frame was modified to withstand the added stress. Even with research and modifications, the docking system was never put in place. The strong and shifting winds above the Empire State Building would not allow for a blimp to actually dock safely, and so the idea was soon let go.

Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable, so any foreign dirigible that was anchored at the Empire State building would cause a safety issue because the high winds at the top of the building could cause an accident to occur causing the dirigible to blow up and potentially endanger pedestrians.

They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment"" just in order to learn how a dirigible flies and how it would be docked. Probably the most important thing the workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public.

Hydrogen is a flamable substance which the builders had to be carefull with power and electricity supplies. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they need to work on the framing of the building so it there is any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse, and would be stable.

10472	16422	6	The obstacles which the builders of the empire state building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that, other dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which is what dirigibles in the United States used. The owners didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For example a @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible named the Los Angeles, could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. These problems go to show that owners of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																						151	7	164	5	0	0	5.158940397350993	21.571428571428573	46	21	16	6	0	13	75	13.7	12.13	8.58	29	11.7	12.61	13.0	13.9	242

This shows that in order to have the ship still enough to be able to moor it was dangerous. Lastly, a law was passed making it impossible to fly close enough to the building to be able to moor.

Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York was determined to outstrip the Chrysler building by making the Empire State Building much taller. He had goals where the building ""would be equipped For an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers"". The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw it as an opportunity to have a a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there For several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Al Smith's ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this however, was actually constructing the mast which led to a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. If the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Even though this was an obstacle, the modifications to the building had adjusted this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising which made the goas for Al Smith much farther away.Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterwards that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety which was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had faded away and they basically gave up on the project.

The biggest problem was figuring out how to make the mast work.The main obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of strong, violent air currents, the back of the dirigible would turn around and around the mast even when it'll be tied to the mast. It is said in the excerpt that dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighted down with the use of lead weights. Because these would be dangling high above people below it would be dangerous, just in case it falls. Also, builders cannot control nature making this the most difficult.Another obstacle was the stress the body frame at the building will receive if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether. The wind pressure and stress would have been too much for the building's foundation. This was solved by modifying the steel frame of the Building to be stronger to keep the building from collapsing.The attempts at allowing dirigibles to more at the building had many obstacles but in the end it was all for nothing because there is a law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas.	3	3		3																						241	10	266	8	0	0	4.676229508196721	24.4	67	26	15	11	3	18	147	18.1	10.22	8.68	36	14.3	16.08	30.0	13.0	339

If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develope. Another obstacle, being faced, was nature. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast.

In order to overcome this obstacle, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and... over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have to be made."" This is problematic because Al Smith now must spend more time and money than originally planned. Furthermore, another problem is that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a huge obstacle because a fire or explosion ""above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York"", would be catastrophic and could put thousands of people in harms way. Finally the weather at the top of the Empire State building is unsuitable for docking dirigibles: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This is dangerous to the structure of the building, surrounding buildings, and people close by. Due to these problems, Al Smith and the engineers could not complete the Mooring Mast."	4	3		4																						250	11	286	12	0	0	5.084	22.727272727272727	84	20	14	13	11	28	133	15.0	11.55	8.22	43	11.9	13.84	15.75	13.5	378
10640	16590	6	"The builders of the Empire stat building encountered both man made problems and problems from nature while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was the buildings strength. The building's steel was not nearly strong inef to ""transmite pressure from the dirigibe's load to the buildings foundation."" Also ""the winds at the top of the building were always moving and full of violent air currents,"" which would shove the Zeppelin into the edges of the building. It was prohibited for airships to fly too low over urban areas, and so making it illegal for a ship to even dock to the building. Price was also a factor, along with the buildings cost an additional sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework just to make the building strong inuf to accommodate an airship. Through all of those problems the builders encountered no wonder dirigibles docking at the mooring mast was not possible."	4	3		4																						161	7	177	3	0	0	4.950310559006211	23.0	48	17	12	9	3	14	89	13.4	11.15	8.5	31	11.1	11.93	11.6	11.2	238

Saeng and her mother has been thourgh a lot and when she failed the @CAPS1 test, she was more depressed than before, The author concludes this story with this paragraph to give readers the thought oF how it is to be determined to adapt and survive in a different place and though Saeng and her mother are away from their homeland they still enjoy the things they did in Vietnam, like the flowers, and the hot peppers and bitter melons, her friends disagree with the taste but it doesnt stop her from enjoying what she loves most.	2	2		2																						113	2	121	5	0	0	4.415929203539823	56.5	24	15	8	4	9	10	68	27.6	8.84	9.51	15	21.8	23.31	26.5	0.0	144
5985	9541	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined. For example, saeng failed her driver’s test but upon reaching the hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her old home. Also, while she is planting the plant, she sees the geese with a new familiarity. This combined makes her determined to complete her test because having two reminders of both homes, it comforts her to know that she can adapt easily and treasure her memories as well.	3	2		3																						88	4	97	5	0	0	4.829545454545454	22.0	17	16	5	4	2	10	50	12.3	10.15	9.03	17	9.5	12.44	13.25	11.7	127
5992	9548	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation.

5996	9552	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show Saeng’s determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when she’s in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, “It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.”	2	2		2																						108	8	121	6	0	0	4.9907407407407405	13.5	26	16	2	7	1	18	63	8.8	10.14	7.96	19	7.4	9.1	7.0	10.7	159

Also the geese will return and because of that she will take the quiz again. To her it’s like starting all over and hopefully she will pass. Also she loves the hibiscus and seamce thats back maybe she will do so much beter.

6006	9562	4	The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam	3	3		3																						136	7	145	3	0	0	4.522058823529412	19.428571428571427	32	24	11	6	6	11	75	9.6	8.47	7.5	19	8.5	10.41	8.833333333333334	11.2	188
6007	9563	4	The author concludes the sentence on the end to state when the plants start over growing and the geese come back, she will try again. For example, the plants have to grow their pedals back and the geese have to make their home and find food again. The author is saying she will take the test again when the geese come back and the plants grow again.	1	1		1																						67	3	72	2	0	0	4.223880597014926	22.333333333333332	16	14	0	7	4	3	41	9.6	7.09	6.16	5	6.1	9.52	11.5	6.4	76
6010	9566	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																						64	1	66	1	0	0	4.34375	64.0	19	8	0	4	2	5	34	31.0	8.61	9.28	6	24.7	26.85	34.0	0.0	82

6015	9571	4	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem, it’s adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example,  in lines @NUM1 Saeng’s thought’s are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saeng‘s eyes now and swept over her “and” in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept.” This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because it’s gone. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said  “and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” It means that she will overcome all that and move on."	3	3		3																						173	6	187	7	0	0	4.365714285714286	29.166666666666668	42	25	10	9	8	24	97	20.9	8.66	8.8	21	16.6	18.94	17.666666666666668	11.2	220
6017	9573	4	The author concludes the story with this because she is say that she is going to grow with the season chang. She is in a new country and just failed her drivers test. She feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home. In the story @CAPS1 mother says “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake its strong enough to make it through the winter. I think that Saeng can relate to that because if the flower can make it in the winter tha she can make it in a new country.	2	2		2																						95	5	100	0	0	0	4.063157894736842	19.0	19	15	3	4	2	8	60	7.2	5.92	6.91	7	6.0	8.02	8.7	5.7	117

6031	9587	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, “I failed the test,” (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence.	1	2		2																						91	4	99	3	0	0	4.450549450549451	22.75	22	21	2	5	3	10	46	10.9	8.25	7.72	9	8.6	10.44	12.375	8.8	115
6036	9592	4	The author concludes the story with “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because Saeng fails the test by spending her money on a big mac and not having enough for the type of flower her mother sent for. So since Saeng failed the test, she wants to take the test again and make her mother happy.	0	0		0																						73	2	77	2	0	0	4.1506849315068495	36.5	21	11	4	3	4	7	41	16.4	7.09	7.83	4	12.8	15.15	18.75	0.0	88
6040	9596	4	After reading “Winter Hibiscus, I can tell that Saeng is a determined person, and likes nature. I can also tell that she is determined to pass the test. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the beginning of the story, Saeng fails her driving test. She walks home, and as she is walking, she comes across a familiar plant. This takes her to her childhood world. Have her not failed the test, she would have never walked home and come across the plant. The author didn’t want us to forget the reason she walked home.

She misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers. For example, the girl says, “It’s-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", here she stops because she is so upset that she can’t say home.

6049	9605	4	The author ends with this paragraph to show gthat Saeng had. Hope. It shows that there is still hope. The ending paragraph makes you  kind of create your own ending for Saeng.

It tells us that in the spring when everything is coming to life Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in thelast paragraph show how Saeng and her mother have adapted and that new things are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text it says, “I know"", her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. It’s flower aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This means and represents that even though life is different here away from Saeng home they will adapt and survive in their own way."	2	2		2																						143	8	156	5	0	0	4.7272727272727275	17.875	36	22	10	13	6	18	75	12.8	9.87	8.24	16	9.0	11.2	11.4	10.5	188
6071	9627	4	I think the author includes this because she doesn’t want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then “I will take the test again.” This quote is saying she @MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you don’t no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng @MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.	2	2		2																						214	9	221	0	0	0	4.065420560747664	23.77777777777778	35	41	7	9	10	13	136	13.0	6.63	7.07	13	10.5	12.99	18.0	8.8	260
6072	9628	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 @NUM1. When the author write all those things in nature that will happen it symbolized re-birth and a fresh start, a new chance and that is what Saeng needs with her drivers license. The author put powerfully. Put those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a sense of roundness and end with that last paragraph, the story is complete.	2	1		2																						124	8	138	5	0	0	4.491935483870968	15.5	33	15	11	10	5	19	73	8.6	7.71	7.32	14	6.7	8.69	8.333333333333334	8.8	161
6074	9630	4	I believe the author of “winter Hibiscus “ends the story like she did because saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test.  Saeng states in the story “it’s the flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, thes winte hibiscus. That’s what matters.” I think saeng is using this as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam. She plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol. She will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring.	2	1		2																						123	7	134	3	0	0	4.233870967741935	17.714285714285715	29	22	5	7	3	20	69	8.9	6.91	7.73	10	6.6	8.53	10.8	7.8	149
6084	9640	4	I think That The author concludes the story with This paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there. By saying shell do the test again shows that she doesnt want to let ths defeat her in her new home and her new life.	2	1		2																						74	3	79	1	0	0	4.081081081081081	24.666666666666668	13	15	4	3	2	5	45	10.1	6.39	7.21	7	8.2	10.96	13.0	7.8	86
6085	9641	4	The author concludes saeng vow in the story to show that saeng can and does have the ability to overcome obstacle. Saeng  feels like she is a failer.

6091	9647	4	Saeng's peRsonality in this stoRy shows deteRmination and confident. I think she feels that she could do moRe experienced things on different plants. I also think this is a peRfect hobby experience foR someone who loves Plants. I feel that Saeng @MONTH1 have accomplished heR goals of planting.

I think she means that, she is willing to exploRe more plants. I think she @MONTH1 have got this experience of planting fRom heR motheR. To me this @MONTH1 have been a family tradition.

6092	9648	4	The author ended the story with the paragraph in order to show that Saeng is looking forward into her life and with a positive outlook. It shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore. The hibiscus is used as a device for this story’s plot. When changes happen with the hibiscus, changes happen in the story. At first, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she plans it, things start to look up. She begins to accept the change when the last paragraph says, “when they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” it shows that Saeng is looking at her future positively, and with this positive change, the hibiscus is now beginning to bloom. The author concludes the story in a symbolic way that helps express the story’s themes.	3	2		3																						158	9	176	8	0	0	4.474683544303797	17.555555555555557	33	29	8	7	5	21	89	8.4	7.65	7.41	17	6.6	8.31	5.875	9.4	211
6093	9649	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph “Saeng vowed silently to herself” because she Saeng wants to do in proper time and season. “winter season”, the land or soil was so cold that plants was not able to grow properly. ”Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars”, and she Saeng failed the test. ”There was frail, wiry beauty to her Saeng mother that touched Saeng deeply”, she Saeng mother is shining when she worked to plants.

6095	9651	4	The author is trying to convey a sense of hope for Saeng in her new country. After noting that she failed her test, which is probably a citizenship test, the author wants to conclude the story with something that reasures the reader. It is obvious that this test was important because Saeng could not even look her mother in the eye. This was probably why she bought the flower for her mother. The ending reasures the reader so that you don’t wonder how it will workout for Saeng.	1	1		1																						88	5	95	2	0	0	4.465909090909091	17.6	21	12	3	3	0	9	50	8.4	7.89	7.02	9	7.8	8.4	8.8	8.8	120

6103	9659	4	In the story “ Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a well mannered carhoined. The author ended with that paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to persuade even though for away from home. She is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story she had failed a test and the hibiscus test her feeling nostalgic. When she got home her mother greeted her with kinds words kind of acting as an anti-depressent by making her food will not peppers and bitter melons. This kind of made Saeng see the good in life causing her not to give up and be confident that she will pass the test.	3	2		3																						117	5	124	0	0	0	4.205128205128205	23.4	31	17	7	6	3	10	67	10.1	7.09	7.9	17	8.9	10.39	11.0	9.4	151

6111	9667	4	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.	2	2		2																						140	6	148	2	0	0	4.156028368794326	23.5	29	24	4	6	9	10	82	15.7	7.15	7.29	8	12.2	15.14	13.75	9.5	168

Saeng was to buy a plant and bring it home, but when she did so, her mother did not approve. The narrative states ""You what?"" Her mother stared at her incredulously""(Ho ). When her mothesaid this, it showed that she was displeased. The narrative states, ""I-I failed the test""(Ho). Saeng was not proud to displease her parents in any way. By saying, ""When hey come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return  and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again""(Ho), the author is just showing Saeng's love and want to grow foe her parents; it shows maturity."	2	2		2																						129	8	158	10	0	1	4.561538461538461	16.25	31	22	4	6	5	29	72	8.4	7.71	8.01	17	6.0	8.28	5.875	8.5	169
6132	9689	4	She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring.	1	2		2																						87	2	90	1	0	0	4.022988505747127	43.5	14	16	7	5	4	5	51	19.2	6.92	8.52	8	15.3	17.67	22.25	0.0	103

6141	9698	4	In the story the author concludes with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself’ in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she did that to say that you shouldn’t give up. In the story Saeng goes to the store and “touched a petal.” She buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home. In this way it seems Saeng is willing to give up her memories of her past. When she brings home the plant and her mom and her plant it in the garden. I think Saeng is trying to make her new home like her old.	2	2		2																						123	7	131	3	0	0	3.9430894308943087	17.571428571428573	26	21	5	5	5	15	73	9.4	5.4	7.3	8	7.0	10.49	13.0	6.7	141

6152	9709	4	I think that the author uses this quote, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.” @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. “But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?” “BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.” @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable.	3	3		3																						182	14	203	9	0	3	4.284153005464481	13.071428571428571	41	30	12	9	7	29	100	8.9	6.79	6.81	17	6.4	9.18	18.333333333333332	8.5	223
6158	9715	4	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, with the strong paragraph of one sentence starting that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This sentence leaves the reader in suspense while incorporating the main point of the story and combining them to express an idea about what might happen in a continuation on the future of @CAPS1 and this story. After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort her mother and her-self. While she stood watching the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng’s feelings to stay determined and take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a string sentence which not only summerized the story, but left a cliff hangs.	3	2		3																						128	5	141	6	0	0	4.8203125	25.6	37	21	5	3	6	15	68	14.1	10.39	7.62	17	10.9	12.43	14.0	10.8	183
6163	9720	4	The author conclude the story with this paragraph because the author wants to remind the reader and summarize the story.

6182	9739	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. “It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng should be strong even I times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, throught the quiet repition of season upon season…” It shows that saeng realized that the new place that she’s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home – In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that saeng should face the new reality of the world.

6196	9753	4	I think Minfong Ho concluded her story “Winter Hibiscus” the way she did to show the avid determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test. Now that she had a moments of her homeland and her family there she was most likely reminded that they would’ve wanted her to succeed, and so she promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This is why I feel that “Winter Hibiscus” was concluded in this way.	2	2		2																						100	4	106	2	0	0	4.45	25.0	21	19	4	6	4	10	59	12.0	8.48	8.19	14	10.7	12.0	15.0	12.2	136

6203	9760	4	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again,” shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with ”when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”	1	2		2																						213	10	229	9	0	0	4.769953051643192	21.3	50	37	13	13	13	22	116	12.9	10.16	6.89	15	9.0	10.42	11.6	9.4	280

It shows that like the geese who care and come back, she will have time to study and pass her test.

Saeng wants to be comfortable with her new life but isn’t yet because of what one misses. But she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter.

She @CAPS1 it with this because she begins the story with Saeng Failing Her Driver license test. and also she was think that the Winter Hibiscus was good luck after it goes away and how she & fimerlary with @CAPS3 which would be the geese she put @CAPS3 together and thats why she said when the geese comes back and the snow melts......That is why she said it.	1	1		1																						106	5	116	3	0	0	4.308411214953271	21.4	25	13	3	9	7	13	65	25.5	8.08	8.5	9	20.2	21.38	26.5	0.0	133
6255	9812	4	The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Like the geese are coming back she is positive that she can take the test again. She knows that she will pass the test. In the story she said “Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet reptition of season upon season, almost familiar to hernow” This means that when she had just moved here she thought that everything was strange because, she have not seen anything like this before. Now as she is living here to would get use to it because, she knows what will happen nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now	1	2		2																						120	6	128	4	0	0	4.45	20.0	13	18	7	12	0	10	82	11.5	8.42	6.01	6	9.1	10.93	11.2	9.4	155
6256	9813	4	The reader thinks the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl is saying she will try again, and take that test. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng, the girl tock a test and failed it. And she got this flower that brong back memories from the past and decied She tock take this test now that thing are going to get better again. Also when the girl saw those geese flying over her, she knew they will be coming back, coming back after winter in the spring, and when they do her flower will blossom, the one that brings back good memories from the past and she will retake that test and past. Those are some examples of why I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	2	2		2																						132	5	143	7	0	0	4.363636363636363	26.4	30	23	4	7	7	15	79	12.3	7.78	6.86	10	10.0	11.77	13.0	8.8	167
6266	9823	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she’ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she’ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn’t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.	1	1		1																						73	4	77	0	0	0	4.438356164383562	18.25	12	14	4	5	3	6	44	8.6	8.12	7.14	5	6.9	8.96	10.125	8.8	93
6270	9827	4	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is about a young girl who cares for gardening over schoolwork. The given conclusion is explaining, when spring comes, and the winter hibiscus is gone, she will pass the school test she failed before. Saeng only cares for the winter Hibiscus right now, for example, the line “I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” Explains she used all her money on this plant rather than any other food. Also the quote “I failed the test” with Saeng crying shows she failed it only because she was worrying about the hibiscus. In conclusion over the spring, when the winter hibiscus is gone, Saeng will focus on school more rather than gardening. Maybe now she will pass her test and go back to her hobby of gardening.	1	1		1																						129	6	142	7	0	0	4.658914728682171	21.5	37	20	3	12	2	17	69	11.3	9.11	6.91	12	9.3	10.46	12.0	11.5	175
6273	9830	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph to set the sonip theme. In the story, the @CAPS1 represents very important thing to saeng – confidence, beauty, adaptation… some things she can apply to herself, & her memories of her old homeland. She had failed the driving test. Afterwards, she bought the @CAPS1 to comfort her homesickness. I saw the @CAPS1 as a sort of metaphor to Saeng the same @CAPS1, but growing differently in a different area just as she is still the same but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the @CAPS1 budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland by the @CAPS1 blossoming ,it can represent her love for the homeland. When the author wrote “then I will take that test again” it is referring to the new confidence she @MONTH1 have later when the @CAPS1 blooms (another @CAPS1 /person metaphor)	3	3		3																						150	8	167	7	0	0	4.695364238410596	18.875	44	17	10	7	3	24	80	10.3	9.23	7.63	21	8.2	10.39	10.166666666666666	11.5	214
6275	9832	4	The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	2	2		2																						133	4	146	9	0	0	4.443609022556391	33.25	28	18	6	6	6	16	85	16.1	8.48	8.02	17	12.7	15.12	18.666666666666668	11.2	172

6307	9864	4	The auther concluded the story with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is willing to change and she wants to do so by the time spring comes. By change Saeng wants to feel comfertable in @LOCATION1 and be able to remember things from where she used to live and not have to break down and cry.

In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng says, “And that rich, sweet scent – that was familiar too,"" talks about how nice the flowers were and how familiar they were because she reconized the scent. Saeng was already upset about leaving her home in @LOCATION1, then coming to @LOCATION2 and then failing her drivers test, just made it worse, but then she saw the flower and it reminded her of her home, so she felt a little better. So when the author uses that quote, they end the story that way to show that she will have enough courage to try again when the flower blooms."	2	3		3																						144	4	161	12	0	0	4.409722222222222	36.0	31	23	10	11	6	19	82	17.3	8.08	7.83	13	13.8	15.79	18.666666666666668	10.7	185
6318	9875	4	"In stories, author lend them many different ways with many different effects. In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a “touching” affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story. The first example, is in the beginning of the conclusion, it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself”. In this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story. ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again” This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout, the geese in the end, and the failing of the test in the beginning.

6321	9878	4	The author uses this paragraph to conclude to show she’s going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings. For example the story says “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon, almost fimiliar to her now”. Saying that she is getting used to where she is now and wants and is willing to give it a chance.

6323	9880	4	The Author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant “dies” in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle.	2	2		2																						103	3	111	5	0	0	4.796116504854369	34.333333333333336	28	16	3	4	7	14	57	18.3	10.63	9.17	18	14.3	17.6	20.333333333333332	14.6	149
6325	9882	4	He ends the story this way to show that she wants to and is willing to overcome leaving her homeland. In the story she goes to a green house. She is in the green house to test herself. She finds a plant from her homeland and and it reminds her of her grandmother. She finds other plants and they remind her of her homeland and she cries. I think she had a real connection with her grandmother. When they left their home country she probably cried for days its like she lost a part of her sole.	1	1		1																						97	7	104	0	0	0	4.092783505154639	13.857142857142858	19	17	4	1	5	6	59	4.8	5.44	5.95	5	4.0	6.38	6.5	7.4	119
6331	9888	4	She was upset with herself because she bought the hibicus and not the plant seeds. So she starts crying because she remembered how pretty their old one used to be.

6335	9892	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave readers guessing and wondering what will be next. You can tell by the tone of the last paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author seems to leave at tone of suspense.	1	1		1																						69	3	76	5	0	0	4.521739130434782	23.0	15	12	3	3	3	10	40	17.1	8.89	8.32	9	12.0	14.96	18.25	0.0	86
6337	9894	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is becaus now she has something to work for. The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph becaus she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could wait to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger.

6339	9896	4	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers.

When she takes the test again she’ll ve mast to pass due to the comfort of home and she’ll be used to the area being different from her homeland. In order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little but more confident in herself.

6352	9909	4	It shows not to give up, it ends almost  the same way it began, it shows that people should not stay too attached to the past each are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then she will try again later to pass it. Also the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to which is a good way of writing. One last thing is that it shows that people shouldn’t become too attached to the past because if they look at one thing that reminds them of it they @MONTH1 fall apart, that is why she takes the test, to see if she can look at the familiar flowers without falling apart.	2	2		2																						141	4	150	4	0	0	4.077464788732394	35.5	21	29	6	10	1	11	89	15.5	6.74	7.29	11	12.3	14.4	12.5	6.0	173

The author’s reasoning for saying this is because the presence of memories from Saeng’s homeland comforts her. So much that they she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous. “it was like walking into another world,” said Saeng, when she entered the florist shop, after failing her drivers test. It was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was only thinking about the plants, flowers. The flowers take her to a happy peace and make her feel at home. Like everything is going to be alright. This is  why the author concludes with such a sentence because us as readers should show memories of her farmland will help her pass her drivers test.	2	3		3																						163	8	179	9	0	0	4.615853658536586	20.5	35	24	7	9	4	23	96	12.1	9.29	7.5	21	8.8	10.3	13.75	9.2	220

6360	9917	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination. Saeng has been through a lot and misses what its like at home. She feels different and out of place but she is still strong. Life goes on, and this paragraph shows that Saeng with move with it. The paragraph says, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring will come, as nothing can stop time. The snow will melt because the weather changes. The geese will fly home and the hibiscus will bloom in spring. Saeng takes a positive look at things and decides to join them. Sure she failed once but she is strong and willing to try again. If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Saeng will always have her memories of home but she is willing to change to her new sorroundings.

6376	9933	4	The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young childs favoriteplant is the hibiscus. I think that the mother and her childs favorite thing to do together would be gardening. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the read kind of a look of question on their faces. It leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. But in my opinion I think it adds some curiosity to the story.	1	1		1																						95	7	102	0	0	0	4.315789473684211	13.571428571428571	21	11	6	5	3	6	56	5.7	6.72	6.8	9	5.1	7.55	6.785714285714286	8.8	127
6381	9938	4	Primarily why she said that was she was saying with time come s cause. She was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well. I depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in Vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. That is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase. But I think as much I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and finally I believed Saeng said this because time brings change.	2	1		2																						108	6	114	0	0	0	4.37037037037037	18.0	20	21	2	10	4	8	62	8.2	7.42	7.6	16	6.8	9.79	9.0	10.5	143
6390	9947	4	The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home. She won’t spend so much time dreaming about her past. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” I believe that thats what she needed to get on with her life.	1	1		1																						69	3	76	3	0	0	4.478260869565218	23.0	18	13	3	2	1	11	37	16.9	8.72	8.32	8	13.2	14.96	18.75	0.0	91
6391	9948	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to let us know when she’l take it again. When the season change is when she will take it again. Saeng is probably embrassed that why she wants to wait so long. Saeng took a long walk home and stoped at the flower shop. She tried getting her mind off failing the test. Saeng brought a nice flower/plant for @MONEY1. Her mother was upset at first, then realize her daughter wasn’t happy and changed her mood.	1	1		1																						84	7	94	1	0	0	4.4523809523809526	12.0	21	16	4	8	2	12	43	5.5	6.95	7.05	7	4.4	5.75	5.428571428571429	6.9	105
6408	9965	4	I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to get used to the new country and surroundings. In the story, the author is showing home sickness. The author see a plant that is know where she come from and buy for over @NUM1 her mother couldn’t believe it. She didn’t want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again. The last sentence is showing that author is trying to adapt.	1	1		1																						90	5	96	1	0	0	4.366666666666666	18.0	17	19	4	5	3	9	51	8.2	7.31	6.99	8	6.8	8.53	8.6	7.6	119
6433	9990	4	The conclude the story this way because he can now expand on this story creating a sequel about Saeng’s success. Also be ending the story this way the author is showing now a limit Saeng is and now she will stop at nothing until her test is complete. Saeng is having difficulties adapting to her new lifestyle because the plants and the previous luteries that she had are no longer present. In the story Saeng’s determination is shown when her mother finds out that she spent @NUM1 dollers to have a simular plant. The mother responds by saying their whole garden is worth less than @NUM1 dollers.	1	1		1																						107	5	112	0	0	0	4.588785046728972	21.4	27	14	10	6	2	11	59	10.9	8.94	8.39	17	9.3	10.8	11.2	9.4	148
6446	10003	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home land she will eventualy pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misss the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.	2	2		2																						136	9	145	0	0	0	4.0588235294117645	15.11111111111111	26	21	9	8	4	11	81	5.2	5.27	6.13	12	4.5	7.22	7.833333333333334	6.9	167
6455	10012	4	The author ends the story by saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story. When she gets home her mother “noticed the tear staie on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.” Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story but by the end she felt happy and optimistic.	2	1		2																						95	3	101	4	0	0	4.273684210526316	31.666666666666668	21	14	6	4	6	13	51	22.4	7.91	9.15	8	17.1	19.84	25.25	0.0	117
6467	10024	4	The author ends it with that because it shows that she won’t give up and that she will give her new country a chance. She ends it with that to say that she will be strong like the flower and that she will stay no matter what! That she will be there, in that spot to see it grow back. That's why I think she concluded with that.	1	1		1																						68	4	74	1	1	0	3.823529411764706	17.0	5	11	2	4	2	6	52	5.1	4.12	5.41	1	4.0	7.39	7.75	6.0	75

6479	10036	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time.

6483	10040	4	"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"". The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese & the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one."	2	3		3																						159	8	188	10	0	0	4.389937106918239	19.875	37	23	12	10	10	25	89	12.6	7.55	7.94	15	10.0	12.04	13.75	10.1	205
6485	10042	4	I think the author concludes this paragraph in this story to describe how grown up Saeng is now since it doesn’t look like she leaves with her mom anymore. To the author probably wants to emphasize the reader @CAPS1 of Saeng, now on for she probably leave since she doesn't leave with her mom anymore.

6490	10047	4	In the story the “winter Hibiscus” by minfong Ho the writers ends with a paragraph that concludes the story. One of the reasons she concluded with the last paragraph the @CAPS1 she did is because it tells the reader that Saeng  @CAPS1 not given up on her drivers test. “… Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This explains in more details when  she will take the test Again another years on is because it leaves the reader to think how the rest of the story will go.	1	2		2																						109	4	118	3	0	0	4.241071428571429	28.0	27	15	5	3	2	15	66	26.2	8.26	9.24	13	21.0	22.53	27.0	0.0	143
6493	10050	4	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says “when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.” The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on.	2	2		2																						120	6	129	4	0	0	4.308333333333334	20.0	31	17	5	3	4	12	70	10.9	7.49	8.51	19	10.3	12.6	11.8	11.2	162
6496	10053	4	I think the author ends the story like this becuose of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a simple of her home but also as a symble of good luck. In the text she holds the plant in a very high value, having payed @NUM1 coins for it, So I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing.	1	1		1																						81	3	87	2	0	0	3.876543209876543	27.0	19	11	3	4	1	10	47	10.3	5.0	7.9	7	9.1	12.28	14.5	8.8	98
6497	10054	4	The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to @LOCATION1, the geese show her that she is, even now adapting to her new homeland when she geese seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was pretty but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she came to @LOCATION1, is adopted to the mre resilient and withstand the snow which symbolizes her problems adapting to @LOCATION1. For saeng, the hibiscus budding again represents her becoming stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to go take the test again when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to connect the Hibiscus budding with Saeng overcoming her obstacles.	3	3		3																						130	6	142	6	0	0	5.084615384615384	21.666666666666668	32	24	9	4	4	13	70	13.3	11.43	7.99	23	10.6	11.76	16.25	13.3	192
6498	10055	4	The author chose to conclude the story like that because sheâ€™s saying that it isnâ€™t over and sheâ€™s going to take the test again. In the story Saeng says â€œI- I failed the testâ€� so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.	1	1		1																						49	3	52	0	0	0	4.428571428571429	16.333333333333332	9	12	2	4	2	7	27	11.7	8.36	9.69	4	8.1	10.62	12.75	0.0	60
6501	10058	4	In the story “winter hibiscus” by minfong Ho, the author is concluding the story with this last sentence because its showing everyone that the seasons over for the growing of the plants but when it comes time for the flowers to start growing again she will be back to take care of the plants because its her favorite & they are what she lives for now that she has to take care of them. Also the author probably put the conclusion of the story like that to get people interested in reading more of the story later on because your getting left in a sense of suspense, because you don’t know if she really will go back to the plants or just about them. another reason I think, the auther ended it that is because its still snowing she cares about the plans but she isn’t gonna worry about them until it is the right time again. For example she says “when they come back then I will take the test again,“ that’s showing she isn’t giving up on anythin she loves and she will keep trying until she gets it.	1	1		1																						191	5	199	4	0	0	4.2408376963350785	38.2	32	33	5	16	5	15	124	30.3	8.08	9.19	17	24.4	26.37	28.0	13.0	249
6512	10069	4	I think that she was that way to say, hey I didn’t over come something and I’ll be back next year to take the test again like the hibiscus budding when she snow melts and the geese return @CAPS1 year.	1	1		1																						40	1	42	1	0	0	4.025	40.0	10	7	2	2	2	5	23	17.6	6.22	8.38	3	14.2	17.0	21.0	0.0	47
6519	10076	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, “when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again.	1	1		1																						66	2	72	5	0	0	4.53030303030303	33.0	16	10	1	4	2	10	40	32.9	9.24	9.3	6	25.5	27.01	35.0	0.0	83
6523	10080	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home.  For example, she said “I failed,” talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live. For example, she said “its not like the one at home.” That’s why the author concludes this paragraph.	1	1		1																						79	6	88	3	0	0	4.4875	13.333333333333334	17	13	3	4	0	14	44	7.8	8.0	6.62	7	5.9	7.84	6.25	8.2	104
6530	10087	4	The author finished the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason for conclusion is that it is important for Saeng  to feel at home. When the hibiscus buds it wiil remind her of home and this will comfort her, when she feels at peace and at home she will do better on the test.	1	1		1																						82	3	91	6	0	0	4.228915662650603	27.666666666666668	21	10	2	4	4	12	48	19.2	7.74	7.98	6	15.7	17.38	22.5	0.0	103
6531	10088	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one. She shows she isn’t giving up when she brings home the flower to plant. That also shows she will not forget her old home. Also when she says, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” That shows she is giving her new home another shot and isn’t giving up. Another example is when it says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance. She is not giving up on it.	2	2		2																						156	9	171	9	0	0	4.352564102564102	17.333333333333332	23	27	10	12	5	20	93	12.1	7.61	7.05	11	9.9	12.19	13.5	10.5	207
6544	10101	4	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.In the story, glimpses of @CAPS1 home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. “She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.” Here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saeng’s despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, “then I will take that test again.“you can feel her hope. Also, the author want`s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says,”the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security.	3	3		3																						257	11	278	11	0	0	4.5813953488372094	23.454545454545453	65	40	16	11	14	29	144	14.5	9.12	7.76	29	12.1	13.31	29.5	11.2	349

6585	10142	4	She ends it with this sentence because its a sign of new life. Just as the winter that killed the plants ending life, the spring will come and start anew.

6598	10157	4	In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. She puts in examples from the story that could help find these reasons. One reason is that we know she wont give up. In the story she says “Then I will take the test again.” It tells us that she will keep trying and is determined to do so. Another reason is that she’s trying to tell us that there is a future for the hibiscus. How is when she says “…and this hibiscus is budding,” that the hibiscus has a chance to change and get use to its surroundings, just like the girl in the story will be doing. Last reason is that it tells us that she is and will be doing her best. When she says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought were strange…, almost familiar to her now,” @CAPS1 trying to get use to her surroundings and now realizes she can.

6625	10184	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because is symbolizes the hope that things will get better. The author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year. So can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will. This is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note. The girl spends the entire day wishing that she were back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends. But this paragraph is the girl vowing a promise to her self that she will withstand the winter until spring and it will get better when she can take the test again. The entire story builds up to this turning point when Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter.

Saeng might have failed this test, but shes not giving up hope on passing it. She believes she will pass that test in the spring, when the time is right. Saeng might miss her home, but she won’t tell that interfer with her future. That is why the author concludes the story with “when they comeback, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return andthis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that tests again.	2	1		2																						115	6	131	9	0	0	4.530434782608696	19.166666666666668	29	19	4	5	4	16	63	9.5	8.24	7.61	10	6.1	8.38	7.5	6.4	140
6631	10190	4	The author concludes the story this way with a quote that says she will get another try at something. Many authors end stories at a diff way because it makes the reader wants to go on to a sequal or the next story, and I really adds a twist to the ending. Also another reason a author would end like that is because they want you to work your imagination so you picture what happens next. Using this is effective because you know what has happened and It make the reader wonder if she  fails or succeeds the next time around.	1	1		1																						101	4	107	1	0	0	4.166666666666667	25.5	18	20	5	4	4	7	64	11.0	7.09	7.55	9	9.6	10.91	13.75	9.5	136

Even though it @MONTH1 not be right away, Saeng wants to try to see all of the flowers that remind her of home again without breaking down. She can tell that although her mother is understanding, Saeng has let her down a little bit. “But how could you? You know how much we–what happened?” when her mother says this, she feels that she has let her mother down. But then, Mrs. Panouvong expresses that she is glad Saeng got it, after hearing that she had failed. Sensing her mother’s inkling of disappointment, Saeng wants to try again.	2	2		2																						114	7	127	6	0	2	4.508771929824562	16.285714285714285	20	22	4	8	1	19	66	8.0	7.77	7.22	12	6.1	7.57	7.666666666666666	6.9	143
6638	10197	4	In “Winter Hibiscus” Saeng took her driver’s test and failed it. She she wants to try and take it again in the spring. I think she ends the story say that because in the spring the hibiscus plant that she got and her and her mom planted, will be growing and blooming and the geese will be back with makes her feel more at home. That way she will feel comfort and be able to take the test and pass, because it will remind her of being home.	2	2		2																						88	4	94	2	0	0	4.0	22.0	15	17	4	3	8	9	55	8.4	5.51	6.7	4	7.2	9.25	11.5	7.2	102

In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the paragraph by saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” One reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to help show that things will change come spring. For example in the story the girl saids “I-I failed the test.” By her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change. She can get better, so that this time she will pass. Also, “The ""winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and @CAPS1 tamped down the soil around it.” This quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now, but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed. In conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future."	2	2		2																						185	9	202	8	0	0	4.616216216216216	20.555555555555557	45	38	4	7	6	23	101	15.7	9.47	7.64	17	11.8	13.18	18.0	9.3	238
6647	10206	4	The reason why the aurthor wanted to put that last paragraph down because they want to keep the reader interested in the story.

6656	10215	4	The author minFong @CAPS1 concludes the story with this paragraph to envoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessions anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try. Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that “never giving up is important” is presented and carried out hopefully through the character’s vow. This principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with. In conclusion, hope is envoked within the reader because of the ending paragraph which contributes to the over all theme of the entire story; it is important to never give up and always have hope especially when life gets hard.	2	2		2																						149	5	158	3	0	0	4.885906040268456	29.8	35	22	8	12	4	18	81	16.5	11.27	8.61	23	13.7	14.34	14.75	13.0	218
6657	10216	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sounds better and it makes the story sound a bit more better when the author put that paragraph in the start. If the author did not put that ending at the end of the story the story probably wouldnt be that intresting and be that good of a story if the author didn’t put that ending paragraph at the end of the story. Also the author wants to make the reader understand the story end end or the start all at the same time. For example if there were no good ending at the end of this story no body would want to read at all not a bit so it was a good thing for the author to put a good end stable ending paragraph at the end of the story. I think ic it was a very good paragraph for the end of the story. It just really seemed to mach the story and I could also really understand it a lot better because of the ending paragraph. It was just the perfect ending for this story.	0	0		0																						189	9	197	0	0	0	3.9576719576719577	21.0	43	24	11	12	4	5	116	10.7	5.75	6.23	7	10.3	11.43	13.5	8.8	246
6664	10223	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. So when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng still doesn’t like the change and would like to go back to her old home	2	2		2																						102	5	106	0	0	0	4.264705882352941	20.4	23	16	8	5	4	5	58	8.8	7.25	6.66	8	7.7	9.34	11.0	8.8	130

Throughout the essay, Saeng is depressed she had to leave her homeland so hurriedly losing her childhood and beloved grandmother, “A blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone.” as Saeng narrates in deeper detail. Also contributing to the feelings of sorrow in the story is how much saeng cries remembering her tragic past. Im both the greenhouse, recalling the events of her grandmother such as when she says, “Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it."" and in the garden, when she talks to her mother and plants the flower.

6727	10286	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, “Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,” This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, “Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person.	2	2		2																						141	5	155	12	0	0	4.73758865248227	28.2	38	17	11	7	4	17	74	18.5	10.11	8.3	21	14.7	17.24	15.25	13.8	202
6736	10295	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagein what rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example when the author said “then I will take that test again.” Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story. For example when the author said “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”.

I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home.

She failed once at getting a job, but she @MONTH1 believe that the Hibiscus is good luck so she sets a goal on when to try for the job again. When she saw the plant, she remembered happy memories.

6780	10339	4	I think that the author concludes the story she fails the driving test, so they added she was going to take it over. And maybe the plant is or would be good luck to her after the snow melts and the geese return it would be a fresh Start. Also it would be nice after she descovered the plant.	1	1		1																						59	3	63	1	0	0	3.9491525423728815	19.666666666666668	10	8	4	3	3	5	37	7.0	5.22	6.22	3	6.3	8.56	10.166666666666666	6.4	70

Saeng wants to prevail she wants to stick it out and the rough times she’s going through make it very difficult for her. When Saeng says “I – I failed the test” this shows that saeng feels disappointe that she didn’t  expect that because she is a fighter, So the author ends the passage with saeng saying” When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To show how much of a fighter Saeng is because she’s determined to strive under difficult conditions.	2	2		2																						127	6	137	5	0	0	4.421875	21.333333333333332	28	27	8	5	3	19	68	15.4	8.66	8.45	12	12.2	14.61	13.5	11.2	162

6798	10357	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how some some people vowed silently because the don’t want to express themselves. Also maybe because they are not very mistful of people even themself. One day I was  like that I didn’t want to talk to anybody. All I want to do is sit in my room and think. Think about my life were I am going to go after i die. I just woulnd sit in my room in the dark wondering if in my room in the dark wondering if I  would come back in another body or will my soul roam the earth.

6802	10361	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show determination and hope. The geese and the  hibiscus symbolize saeng’s determination, because they always come back no matter what. Saeng will be back to take the test , just like the geese will also be back. The hibiscus also symbolize her because it has faced adversity also. It has been taken to new paces and had new homes, much like saeng , and has a harsh winter coming in the near future.  However , it  always  finds a way to come back and bloom in the spring, which is what saeng hopes to do by taking the driver’s test. The author included the last paragraph to show symbolism between saeng  ,the  geese , and the hibiscus.That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	3	3		3																						136	8	155	8	0	0	4.328671328671328	17.875	32	19	7	14	6	16	79	11.4	8.94	6.76	9	10.7	10.62	8.666666666666666	10.9	193

6818	10377	4	The author of “winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.”Saeng, because it creates the mood that Saeng is accepting the changes. Just like nature adapts to climate and location change, saeng seems to appreciate her situation and is deciding her situation and is deciding to make it a positive instead of a negative. The author is showing that if your having trouble, try again; through the main character, Saeng.	2	2		2																						95	3	106	7	0	0	4.821052631578947	31.666666666666668	25	15	5	5	5	15	51	17.1	10.51	8.7	15	13.3	16.47	19.833333333333332	14.6	137

Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph	1	1		1																						118	4	126	6	0	0	4.389830508474576	29.5	24	20	3	9	5	11	74	18.9	8.31	7.33	6	13.9	16.06	25.5	6.4	142

Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can survive through hard times and adapt to changes, and survive she can also.

6830	10389	4	The last paragraph was added in order to represent the determinedness and adapting to new things in Saeng and her family. In the beginning, Saeng held bitterness at failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, she will be a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her being determined to deal with it is that she does make friends, and, though the food she offered was rejected she didn’t give in. The moment of breakdown was as she got the flower. After she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change.	2	1		2																						112	7	123	4	0	0	4.375	16.0	23	18	3	4	6	13	70	7.2	7.25	7.39	14	6.0	8.9	8.833333333333334	9.6	149
6836	10395	4	I thinks that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that she is similar to the hibiscus and geese. First, the geese and hibiscus both have a goal, which is to survive the winters. Geese fly south for the winter to stay warm. This is similar to Saeng worse thing both moved to a different environment where they must adapt. Also, Saeng must experience winter along with the hibiscus. The hibiscus needs tobe strong, to overcome winter, from this, it shows Saeng is like her hibiscus because she needs to be strong to overcome the test. If her hibiscus can overcome it’s test, winter then she can survive to cangner her own.	2	3		3																						116	7	130	7	0	0	4.594827586206897	16.571428571428573	25	19	10	4	2	17	63	8.5	8.35	6.91	10	7.4	8.02	9.0	10.3	158

6844	10403	4	I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasn’t ready for before but now whenever the geese return and the hibiscus return the she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasn’t mentally prepared. So inconclusion I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return the she will take the test and maybe she wasn’t physicaly and mentally prepared for it.	1	1		1																						71	3	74	0	0	0	4.507042253521127	23.666666666666668	10	12	5	8	5	6	43	11.6	8.88	7.04	6	10.2	12.3	14.5	12.5	99
6847	10406	4	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese that flew down south in a beautiful @CAPS1 formation, fly down every season. So she tells herself, @CAPS2, she will take the test again when the geese return and the hibiscus plant is budding. For example, she thinks to herself, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” @CAPS2, looking up at the geese she is almost reminded of an experience she went through somewhat similar.	1	1		1																						103	4	115	9	0	0	4.902912621359223	25.75	20	15	8	11	1	14	60	18.8	10.86	8.4	17	15.5	17.99	20.333333333333332	14.6	154
6853	10412	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph that she did because it was the end and the start of a new beggining. The author uses the sensens in her story. The winter is the current season and spring is on its way. Although Saeng failed her test in the winter when most things die, she is looking forward to spring to start again on her test. The geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life. Saeng will also have new life in her test to pass it this time and drive.

6888	10448	4	I think the author concludes this story wit this ending paragraph because the story is all about how  she feels comforted in the plants and she wants to wait until the weather breaks and the geese to come back to take her test.

6895	10455	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because it shows Saeng will not give up. Saeng failed her drivers test and as she was walking home she found a hibiscus.

6911	10471	4	The author is very creative. He concludes the story saying how the hibiscus is building and that she will take the test agian. She believes that she will do better when the snow is gone. The author ended the story with that because Saeng was very upset failing a test but with the comfort of the hibiscus she’ll be able to do better. He also concludes the story with that paragraph because the climax was when she failed her test and somehow the author had to conclude what was going to happen to Saeng  with the test	1	1		1																						97	5	102	0	0	0	4.295918367346939	19.6	20	16	3	6	3	7	60	8.7	7.6	6.88	10	7.3	8.17	10.1	6.7	129

Most of the story is about the sadness that the narrator experiences because of longing for her homeland, Saeng misses her grandmother and the plants of Vietnam, and she even buys a hibiscus plant to remind her of her homeland. She is also not enjoying @LOCATION2, because she has already experienced failure at her new home.

After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time.

In addition, were she mentions the “test”, it makes to her buyin a fake test.“It’s - it’s not a real one”. She refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is. The test reffs to both the plant and the driver’s test.

6927	10487	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is going to adapt to the conditions of her new life. The hibiscus is a plant that thrives in warm, tropical climates. However it does not survive in the cold; only the winter hibiscus, which can survive in both climates (warm and cold) can. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. She lived in Vietnam and loved it with all the pretty flowers and being with her grandmother. However now that she is living in the United States, she is finding it hard to adapt. Now that she has this hibiscus flower, which adapts to the cold weather magnificently, she can adjust to her new life in the United States. When she sees the geese come back for another spring and summers, she will take the driving test because they are giving her area another chance of being their home for the season.

This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years.	1	1		1																						58	3	62	1	0	0	4.4655172413793105	19.333333333333332	15	5	2	2	2	5	37	9.3	8.24	8.41	11	7.3	9.1	10.666666666666666	8.8	78
6937	10497	4	Minfong Ho, the author of “  Winter Hibiscus ” concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself that she will retake and pass her drivers test in the spring when the geese fly back and plant rebuds. The author concluded the story with this paragraph   to signify Saeng’s   willingness to start over. After failing a test, Saeng visits a green house and misses her old home, Vietnam. She buys a hibiscus and plants it when she comes home after noting the geese flying south for the   Winter. The plant signifies her memories. When she first sees it, it’s blossomed. In the spring it will rebud  and form another blossom while growing bigger. This parallels Saeng   getting over her sadness and homesickness and rebuilding   better memories while growing stronger. When she gets  the chance. The birds flying  overhead are headed south for the winter for shelter from the cold. In spring they will return to start over raise goslings, rebuild their home, start over from last spring. Saeng is planning to start over, and pass it so she can drive and feel more accepted in @LOCATION2. Minfong   Ho, chose to end the story with a paragraph to signify the character’s starting over and rebuilding good memories.	3	3		3																						205	13	236	8	0	0	4.660465116279069	16.53846153846154	53	45	8	7	10	28	96	9.1	9.68	7.58	31	8.3	8.66	8.666666666666666	10.0	301

6944	10504	4	The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.	3	2		3																						83	4	89	2	0	0	5.178571428571429	21.0	26	12	4	2	2	12	46	13.6	12.65	9.04	14	10.2	11.69	13.125	12.6	125
6952	10512	4	The author most likely concludes the story with that paragraph because they are trying to show the reader that even though you fail at something, you can’t be stubborn. So Saeng failed her drivers test but in the spring when the hibiscus plant starts to bud she will go back and take the test again. By the plant budding she thinks of that as a sign that she will pass the test	1	1		1																						72	3	75	1	0	0	4.25	24.0	14	13	1	7	2	5	46	10.6	7.43	7.46	7	7.9	10.16	12.333333333333334	6.4	86
6959	10520	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn’t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story.	2	2		2																						119	6	126	1	0	0	4.512605042016807	19.833333333333332	22	20	4	7	3	11	72	11.7	8.88	7.6	11	9.0	9.52	13.0	6.7	153
6961	10522	4	The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason @MONTH1 be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. “Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too but they come back every year. Along with the flower Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do. She won’t give up but try again later on in the year. This shows how she is adapting and changing to work with her new surrondings.	3	2		3																						154	10	166	2	0	0	4.207792207792208	15.4	29	27	10	6	10	14	93	7.0	6.32	6.64	11	5.2	7.36	7.833333333333334	6.9	189
6969	10530	4	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph about geese to show that Saeng is going to try to overcome her obstacles. She was @CAPS1 disappointed in failing the test so she took comfort in memories of her homeland. She bought a hibiscus that she saw in her homeland a lot, and that flower @CAPS2 comfort and affection. But it also @CAPS2 her ability to come over obstacles, and while she was planting her hibiscus, and saw the geese flying above, she knew she had to try again.	2	1		2																						89	4	97	4	0	0	4.550561797752809	22.25	18	16	4	4	5	11	50	11.1	8.71	7.76	16	9.6	12.52	13.625	12.2	127

6979	10542	4	The author concludes the story with this piece because she said “a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,” I think she means that even tho the geese flew over with their heads up high even tho Saeng’s wasn’t. “Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time.

6997	10560	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and next time that time of year comes back around she will have another chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didn’t even cost that much. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																						71	3	74	0	0	0	4.28169014084507	23.666666666666668	16	11	3	2	1	6	46	10.6	7.55	7.26	4	7.8	10.04	12.5	7.8	86
6999	10562	4	The author included this because she was showing that it was winter and the flower was goin to bloom and the geese were flying here because it is cold.

7005	10568	4	There are many reasons the author says “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again .” @CAPS1 the author said this because the girl left everything just to come to this country and she can not fail. The gil said  “That at last , she could hold on to. But where was the fine-foothed come? the hibiscus hedge? She also said this because the hedge was all she had from her old home besides her mother and when the “hibiscus is budding” means its starting a new life and is starting to grow leafs and the girl is starting grow and move on with her life.	2	2		2																						130	6	142	5	0	2	4.190839694656488	21.833333333333332	23	22	7	8	8	18	78	14.7	7.38	6.95	6	11.2	13.23	13.25	8.1	157
7014	10577	4	In my opinion the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was feeling down about not passing her driving test but when she saw those flowers she realize when she came to @CAPS1 she  forget all about her home town. So she decied to get back in touch with a nature side and hold off taking her test intill the spring instead of rushing things.	1	1		1																						67	2	70	0	0	0	4.352941176470588	34.0	16	14	0	4	2	7	38	16.0	8.6	8.83	13	12.8	14.0	17.25	0.0	88

7035	10599	4	The author concludes with this paragraph te emphasize the new beginning that saeng is looking for. She was so disappointed when she failed her driver’s test. &the hibiscus was the thing to make her happy. she needed a new beginning to start over in a new country &the flower, the flower the snow , the geese, & the test all symbolize new beginnings &challenges to overcome , the geese & snow represent a change in season, the budding hibiscus  represent new life,& the passing of the test represent a milestone in saeng’s life .

7036	10600	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to explain to the reader that she isn’t done gardening, that she’ll  go back when it blooms once again. also she isn’t done. she’d rather garden than go to school. This is what the author concludes about the story with the last paragraph.	0	0		0																						51	4	57	1	0	0	4.596153846153846	13.0	11	9	1	7	0	9	33	13.3	9.52	7.38	3	9.7	10.98	13.25	0.0	68
7043	10607	4	The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means.	1	1		1																						101	6	112	4	0	0	3.6435643564356437	16.833333333333332	14	19	3	8	4	10	70	4.1	2.96	1.61	3	3.9	7.51	7.833333333333334	7.2	112

7050	10614	4	The story of “Winter Hibiscus” is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. Saeng misses her homeland but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, and pass her drivers test. The story is nicely concluded with Saeng's promise to herself that come spring, she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleinates some home-sickness. Saeng’s promise indicates that she is comng to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become.. - Almost familiar to her now.” I feel that was a landmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that by allows to change.	3	3		3																						146	10	161	4	0	0	4.876712328767123	14.6	36	23	6	9	5	21	83	13.8	10.8	9.08	28	10.4	13.27	9.0	12.2	206

Also the author was saying that even in @LOCATION1 it was important to remember his cuban blood and culture.

Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life.

7100	11848	5	In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat mood. He clearly is very grateful for his family, and had a happy childhood. He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negitive for him while growing up, but then he cancelled those negitive things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story, have an upbeat and happy mode. He even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others.	2	3		2																						177	8	198	10	0	0	4.3107344632768365	22.125	31	26	13	15	11	19	114	9.9	7.08	7.05	21	9.5	10.65	15.25	11.5	245

It's like that in my house, just with @CAPS1 things, not Cuban. Also, the narrator explains how everyone in the neighborhood was a close - knit family of Cuban, spanish and Italian people. No one would hurt one other and every one will help in case of a problem, giving a safe feeling. Lastly, All of paragraph @NUM2 and @NUM3 explains how his parents risked everything to be in the @CAPS2. My parents did the same thing and it makes me feel happy that they did.

My mother & father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. They showed me with their own lives & these teachings have been the basis of my life. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent & music but life & love. It was here where i learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	4	3		4																						176	10	194	6	0	0	4.545454545454546	17.6	46	15	10	10	11	17	101	9.3	8.87	6.8	17	7.6	7.98	7.428571428571429	9.4	239

7705	12453	5	This story, basically, brings me back memories myself. In the memoir, the author feels a happy, strong, lovable mood. He feels as @CAPS1 those times, are never going to be forgettable, that he's always going to remember those times. That once he gets older, he will take these good times, as granted. Even during bad times, he will look back. Also he will always be thankful, for what his parents have done, to make his life better, and esier. That way he wouldn't have to life a hard depressed life. Hopefully he will always be thankful for that oppertunity, that his parents gave him. I know that @CAPS1 my parents did that for me, I would never forget them.	1	1		1																						119	9	145	15	0	0	4.554621848739496	13.222222222222221	18	18	11	12	1	23	75	6.6	6.89	6.68	13	6.1	7.3	6.125	8.2	164
3583	5978	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lact of information on were to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go.	1	1		1																						51	3	54	0	0	0	4.1568627450980395	17.0	15	5	1	0	2	4	33	6.7	6.2	7.58	7	7.6	8.37	8.166666666666666	7.8	69
3588	5983	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. For instance, it was extremely hot and dry. Also it  was nearly deserted, almost all of the places he crossed were deserted .A  lost her features of the setting were a ram shackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that caldnt hald in the lamest move.an is the feature give you an idea if haw the cyclist feels.	1	1		1																						70	4	79	4	0	0	4.361111111111111	18.0	17	9	6	4	2	12	38	11.2	8.13	8.63	10	10.0	11.03	13.333333333333334	10.5	96
3589	5984	3	The cyclist was riding through a tower when he stopped for directions. These old men told him to take a short cut and he did and got lost. He was in a ghost town in the desert.

3596	5991	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Initially, when the cyclist went through the road with the big snake in the middle of it made him keep cations and very unease. Furthermore, the desert and nothing around gave the cyclist of abandoness and no help for when he is I trouble. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and that people are there. The features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride.	1	2		2																						84	5	92	3	0	0	4.583333333333333	16.8	23	7	4	7	4	10	49	8.5	8.47	6.91	9	6.3	8.15	8.4	8.8	112
3623	6019	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the desert with no water and doesnt know where he is going. The old men on the porch gave him wrong directions now he is lost in the desert. The cyclist find the will power to keep on moving and he finds help along the way. He finds another old man there that offer him directions but he says he has a map	1	1		1																						72	4	76	0	0	0	3.9305555555555554	18.0	15	13	3	2	3	3	43	6.1	4.99	5.85	4	5.6	7.76	8.75	8.1	89
3624	6020	3	The setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” He uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting. He describes the intense heat inthe desert of California, pedaling up, “ one long, crippling hill.” The terrain did not make his rideeasy at all. The factor of weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water take a tall on him. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine.	2	2		2																						132	6	147	10	0	0	4.356060606060606	22.0	35	16	9	8	3	22	73	12.3	7.49	8.3	19	10.0	12.08	18.333333333333332	8.8	173
3629	6025	3	Some of the features of the setting affect the cyclist like the road was bad it had bumps all over that made it much harder and it also took up a lot of strength.

3630	6026	3	"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. “This sight was troubling” when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. “At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.” He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived."	3	3		3																						205	13	226	7	0	0	4.351219512195122	15.76923076923077	50	29	20	5	11	26	110	16.1	7.85	7.95	22	13.1	14.85	8.166666666666666	10.5	258
3636	6032	3	The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						71	6	82	2	0	0	4.464788732394366	11.833333333333334	18	12	2	2	0	9	42	5.5	6.89	6.67	9	6.7	6.41	6.083333333333333	9.3	103
3643	6039	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						119	9	135	2	0	0	4.258333333333334	13.333333333333334	27	16	11	8	2	16	72	7.3	6.38	7.53	14	6.4	8.14	8.166666666666666	8.4	152
3645	6041	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because the roads are too rough. If he gos too pot he could spin out of commission and the water was trouble. He sad “when I tried a deep or two it had the flavor of a battery acid.	2	1		2																						46	4	49	0	0	0	3.891304347826087	11.5	10	6	3	3	2	4	27	4.6	4.34	7.48	6	4.5	6.99	7.0	6.4	57
3654	6050	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist’s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, “ I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph” This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story.	3	3		3																						336	20	377	21	0	0	4.553571428571429	16.8	81	35	28	25	9	47	198	9.3	8.41	6.96	36	8.2	9.15	8.833333333333334	9.6	470
3655	6051	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty “…. I came to a fork of sorts, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling. “when she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be @NUM1 degrees. “Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. “This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. It was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding	1	1		1																						148	11	165	7	0	0	4.261744966442953	13.545454545454545	35	21	17	2	3	24	78	8.1	7.08	7.88	18	5.7	7.63	10.2	6.0	183
3662	6058	3	The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the “town” had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this “town” is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road.	2	1		2																						132	8	143	3	0	0	4.143939393939394	16.5	32	14	5	8	2	14	85	6.3	5.91	7.09	12	5.0	7.81	6.714285714285714	7.2	163
3669	6065	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, “Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.”	2	2		2																						110	8	124	8	0	0	4.6	13.75	31	13	4	3	4	19	63	8.1	8.23	7.14	13	7.1	8.83	8.0	10.9	153
3682	6078	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The cyclist also had a lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map.	2	2		2																						78	5	83	0	0	0	4.089743589743589	15.6	21	11	3	3	4	5	44	5.6	5.8	6.64	8	5.8	8.29	7.800000000000001	8.8	101
3688	6084	3	There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, “several rusty bumps,” is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn’t riding on smooth ground he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also he had a huge lack of water he was water depleted he couldn’t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. “Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,''  this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehidrated, and very tired.	3	2		3																						107	4	123	10	0	0	4.611111111111111	27.0	26	16	8	5	2	20	55	13.8	9.06	9.25	15	11.4	13.71	14.75	12.6	151
3694	6090	3	There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	1		1																						87	4	95	3	0	0	4.137931034482759	21.75	14	11	6	8	2	8	61	8.9	6.27	7.08	7	7.1	10.1	11.625	8.1	107
3699	6095	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man’s journey he was confident in his abilities. “I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.”  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June” without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey."	3	3		3																						235	11	262	11	0	0	4.711864406779661	21.454545454545453	68	33	12	9	12	35	124	20.4	10.11	9.01	35	16.1	18.51	19.333333333333332	14.1	332

One way it affect the cyclist is it by being hotlike a says in the text""I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgerous day in June ""@CAPS1 way it affects the cyclist by being bumby like it says in the text ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" that is how the setting affects the cyclist."	1	1		1																						66	3	74	0	0	0	4.303030303030303	22.0	22	8	1	1	0	9	33	15.3	7.5	8.62	11	12.6	13.81	17.0	0.0	89
3716	6112	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in most of the story. The heat made him hot & thirsty while the travel gave him a lack of energy and even     of a need for water. In paragraph @NUM1 the writer says one of the hills was “long and a               “ The hill was wearing him out & draining what was left of his energy. The setting of the story was the biggest party if the road was flat and bumpy while the tempeture was	1	1		1																						85	4	90	0	0	0	3.9770114942528734	21.75	22	8	6	1	5	9	49	7.5	5.22	7.52	10	10.2	9.28	11.375	8.1	124
3721	6117	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Ti’s better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing what’s going to happen next.	1	1		1																						125	11	138	1	0	0	4.388888888888889	11.454545454545455	26	20	8	6	5	14	72	5.1	6.59	6.6	10	5.4	5.52	5.777777777777778	8.8	170
3722	6118	3	As the features changed in the setting it becomes harder for the cyclist .At first the cyclist stoned off pretty easy .He had plat smooth roads to go through .He started out before the sun could to him.” The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite my name written all it “He kept his mind off the sun and this helped him .Then, he got to a highway that made it kind of harder .I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills “So he had to pedal harder and would tire him faster.” At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path. Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state “.By the tumble weeds that means he was in the desert during a hot period of time .So he had little water left and he was becoming dehydrated .This was a hard task for him to overcome .By the terrain changing it become harder for him.	3	2		3																						161	9	167	3	0	0	4.229813664596273	17.88888888888889	35	31	15	5	4	17	82	25.3	7.5	9.14	16	20.7	21.98	25.0	9.7	202
3725	6121	3	The features of the setting greatly  effected the cyclist.  He was  riding along   on a  route he had little confidence would end up anywhere. That being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework. The temperature was very hot, where was little shade, the   sun was beating down on him. The route was very discouraging .all the cyclist wanted wanted   was water and the route kept touenting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that approved to be an old bottling factory for Welch’s  grape  juice. The cyclist would appear  to be closing in on something to drink, but be left with nothing.	3	2		3																						146	9	168	4	0	0	4.217948717948718	17.333333333333332	30	21	12	7	5	17	85	9.8	7.83	7.05	18	9.1	9.73	8.0	8.4	208
3734	6130	3	The features of the setting keep affecting the cyclist because first its hopeful then he relizes its hopeless. He was laughting when people told him the right directions and now “It was sad, hopeless laught, mind you, but at least I still had energy to feel bad for self.” said the cyclist when he was refering back to the first town. The reason this affect the cyclist is at first he was going good then he got thirsty and bad things happened.  thats how it affect th cyclist.	1	1		1																						88	4	97	3	0	0	4.382022471910112	22.25	17	15	10	8	3	12	50	14.1	8.43	7.6	10	11.2	13.54	16.0	9.7	115
3736	6132	3	This is how the setting effects the cyclist. One is the hot dry California desert heat. It was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water. The hot desert heat had made water a for like a substance which he could not drink from the well. The water bottle only containe a few tentalizing sips which was not enough to quench his thirst. The hot heat that would make birds pick him drys all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice. It made him realice that in time comes wisely and youth can make silly mistakes. The heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive. That is ho the setting effects the cyclest.	3	3		3																						130	9	139	0	0	0	4.161538461538462	14.444444444444445	30	18	15	3	2	12	75	5.4	5.85	6.9	14	5.4	6.99	6.714285714285714	6.9	163
3740	6136	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster. The road might be up the hill so he @MONTH1 go slow. There could be a possibility that the road might have bump rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through. So the affect of the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made.	1	1		1																						74	5	79	0	0	0	4.081081081081081	14.8	15	9	1	5	1	5	49	5.2	5.33	6.72	7	4.3	7.0	6.8	6.7	90
3748	6144	3	The cyclist knowing not where he was going got a wrong enformation and he followed it. He was excited to know that he knows where he’s heading too. Along his journey he was aciccted with a lot of things like the sun. The weather condition of their exaction and the big snake he saw. He was affected by sun because he was dehydrating and he almost had no water left for him as it was also becoming so hot alike makes the journey very difficult for and made his mood strange while also following the direction he was disfernded by a big snake he encounter at the case slic desn't while succeed their add was scared that he was going to be attacked unlike anyone to make his way through. The features affects him because he doesn’t know where he was going and he wait a as her cut.” Then he was going to wrong direction and he wasn’t prepared for the journey because the weather condition was” summer time” it was hot and he was riding a bicycle not a car.	3	2		3																						182	7	188	0	0	0	4.241758241758242	26.0	30	33	11	10	7	16	108	13.7	7.67	7.74	19	12.7	13.88	12.4	12.2	248
3751	6147	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist. The setting takes place in June. It is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated. You can imagine how hot it got when it said, “wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down	2	1		2																						67	5	71	1	0	0	4.149253731343284	13.4	12	12	5	4	1	7	38	6.5	6.03	7.3	7	6.3	7.91	7.875	7.2	87
3753	6149	3	The features of the settings in “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through todi, California which is a rough area to ride. The ride was hot and long that he was so dehidrated that sweat was dried around his neck. The solo cyclist says “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” He had no where to get water or food. It was deserted. He thought if he died no one would find him faster the birds would pick him clean. The essay “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by @PERSON1 shows a solo cycilist are very independent.	2	2		2																						119	7	131	4	0	0	4.294117647058823	17.0	33	15	9	4	4	21	62	7.3	6.67	7.93	19	6.4	8.82	8.166666666666666	8.4	152
3759	6155	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a lot of ways. in the essay, the author describe how the setting is hot, it is bumpy, it makes him sweat, it makes him tired, he is also, running out of water from his thirst. The road gets, very rocky at one point. The narrator states “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (Kurmaskie @NUM1). There is also a photograph that shows how rough the terrain is. It is barrain with nothing around it.	1	1		1																						85	6	101	8	0	0	4.376470588235295	14.166666666666666	20	11	8	3	0	17	47	7.7	6.67	8.01	10	6.4	8.68	8.3	8.2	108
3761	6157	3	The settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the ‘@CAPS1 town” he isn’t really warried he is kind of laughing and thinks his funny by saying.” This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time  - say, before the last world war.” Then after he says that it ways he chuckled. When he gets the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water he begins to switch into conservation made and begins to get is scared. He says.” I would comer  water- a test at my inner spirit “ This showing that he was scared. After he sees the abanoned Grape juice factory he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind same expensive biking gear. This definatly shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction. When he finally reaches the balt shop he is releved and goes to the bathrom and drinks water. He  also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn’t have a rod. These examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist.	3	2		3																						209	12	223	1	0	0	4.183962264150943	17.666666666666668	39	38	15	10	5	24	119	9.0	6.91	7.93	21	7.9	9.28	13.0	8.8	271
3765	6161	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, the road could be bumpy, and the town could be deserted. For example, ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty. And if he is not and with no water he probably could  barely make it up the hills. And with no town for water he would be thirsty.""First ""town"" This place might have been a thriving little spot at one point but anthor warning it fit the outsides of ghost town"" No waters"	2	2		2																						99	8	113	3	0	0	4.217821782178218	12.625	26	7	7	2	5	14	58	8.7	6.79	7.49	15	7.5	9.13	10.5	7.6	126
3772	6168	3	As the reader listened and followed the directions of the old-timers he faced many issues and also learned a leason. As he began to ride into the day break of morning he had strong legs and even a smile on his face. As time went on he soon became close out of water and a loss of energy. The @CAPS1 summer day made him sweat and began to think that he birds would pluk at his body as if he would die on his ride to Yosemite. When he finally got to a town he soon refreashed and learned that he would and start to began to follow his own way: of getting to places	2	2		2																						115	5	122	0	0	0	3.8956521739130436	23.0	25	22	5	5	7	9	66	8.4	5.23	6.84	8	7.5	10.24	10.8	8.2	141
3773	6169	3	The features of the setting in the essay “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn’t make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far , I’d be fine”. He seemed unsure and a little nervous. As the journey continued, the cyclist loses hope it seems. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary” He does not see himself finishing this journey the more and more he rides in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except “Rough Road Ahead” signs.	2	2		2																						175	10	192	9	0	0	4.36	17.5	41	27	10	9	7	27	102	10.1	7.54	8.08	24	8.3	10.56	11.0	9.2	232
3774	6170	3	The features in the setting are very effective to the cyclist. He is in a desert area of California and he has limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry. He barely had an water to drink and he had to go a long way in the hot and humid weather. The deficiency of water could have made him became dehydrated. Another obstacle that he had during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park was the hills that he faced. At the beginning, he was on flat terrain, now he has hills that he has to pedal up that makes it a lot harder for him. One other obstacle that he faced was the snake he ran into. That setting had many obstacles for this guy. If it wasn't for the heat and lack of water, he might have been able to make it a little easier.	1	1		1																						149	10	163	3	0	0	4.0	14.9	32	18	13	5	5	13	98	4.9	4.81	6.81	17	5.6	8.38	7.428571428571429	9.4	198
3775	6171	3	"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The rolling hills were the cyclist’s most challenging problem because they were long and cripppling. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatsroke. However, the cyclist kept a possitive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and wilbells fish camp.” In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort. But with determination,you can accomplish anything!"	3	3		3																						152	9	166	4	1	0	5.243421052631579	16.88888888888889	34	27	10	9	9	16	80	12.8	12.59	8.21	27	10.7	11.55	10.666666666666666	12.2	237
3776	6172	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit.” The cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does. The narration states, “ a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit … sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie). Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist making him tired due to lack of water and sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die.	2	1		2																						132	6	142	1	0	0	4.285714285714286	22.166666666666668	32	24	13	5	6	11	60	10.0	7.54	7.51	15	8.2	9.91	7.666666666666666	7.8	173
3778	6174	3	The setting had a huge affect on the cyclist. One affect was the lack of water in the area he was in, which was a dessert. Also, the lack of people in the area didn’t help the cyclist out at all. The hills on the road made it more tougher on the cyclist because it drashed what little energy he had left. Also, the sun beating down on him made his body more warm and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do.	1	2		2																						89	5	97	3	0	0	3.831460674157303	17.8	20	10	4	7	1	9	58	5.5	4.12	7.0	6	5.5	7.57	8.1	5.7	109
3781	6177	3	In the story the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest problems was the terrian that he had to maneuver them. The terrain was hilly, having to go up a hill on a bike is tireing and wears you out faster than flat land would, and making him use more energy. The heat was also unbearable making it harder for him to focus, the cyclist did everything he could to keep consiese while  manuvering threu the terrain and deserted landscape being a huge desert of rolling mountains he pushed forwad, finding no civilization anywhere to get a refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn’t as hilled then it would of made it easier for him using less energy and less strain on his legs, the heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress also. Heat will make you move slower and a cyclist moving down a  barnest road with no shade will make the journey seem longer, and imposible. In the end his will and determination got with threw the landscape, so he could get the water he needed to finish his trip	2	2		2																						190	6	206	9	0	0	4.375	32.0	40	34	13	10	7	22	114	15.2	8.48	8.87	28	13.3	15.21	19.333333333333332	11.9	260

3787	6183	3	The terrain in “Do not exeed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, “I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.	2	3		3																						136	9	155	7	0	0	4.970802919708029	15.222222222222221	43	22	7	8	2	24	68	9.7	10.14	7.75	21	8.0	8.69	6.875	10.7	202

3796	6192	3	The features of the setting that the author cyclist through definitely effect not only his mood, but his the physical condition. To start, it is mentioned that he is in “the high deserts California in June,” @CAPS1 it is implied that the weather is hot causing the author to sweat as he bikes along. Next there is a change in terrain an he soon approaches “rolling hills” which are more difficult to bike on. Finally the author sees a sign that reads “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit but he still has to manage getting past the rough road. After passing this road he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated before. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the author’s change in mood.	3	3		3																						168	8	178	3	0	0	4.636904761904762	21.0	38	27	12	13	5	18	88	12.4	9.52	8.59	28	10.3	12.46	14.5	11.5	235
3800	6196	3	The ways that can effects the cyclist by the setting of the place are how the road is shaped or the riding up the hills and the roughness of the rode. There were an sign where it said “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit.” That sign if he didn’t see it he would have over the speed or didn’t know what the speed he was to go as a cyclist and gotten hurt. The road was made for the cars so the speed limit is hard to	1	1		1																						90	3	93	0	0	0	3.7888888888888888	30.0	22	14	1	1	4	6	56	11.4	5.0	7.41	7	9.1	12.0	15.0	3.1	103
3813	6209	3	This cyclist had the conditions of the land to deal with, He didn’t have too much water with him and there wasn’t a good source anywhere near him that he could see. He just had to keep going. He also talked about how the road was rough. This was conflicting on how long it took him to get to the next place with water. More over he was in a desert area. The air was dry and hot, the heat was making him sweat and that was leading him to become dehydrated.	2	2		2																						92	6	100	2	0	0	3.9565217391304346	15.333333333333334	12	18	6	7	3	10	63	4.9	4.57	6.28	5	4.5	7.42	7.166666666666666	7.2	110
3814	6210	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclist’s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up “Ghost towns” and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says “what I believed was my last burst of energy,” “I was going to die.” The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die.	2	2		2																						121	5	127	2	0	0	4.322314049586777	24.2	25	22	8	1	6	16	68	11.0	7.72	7.97	15	9.2	11.0	13.5	8.8	158
3816	6212	3	It the short story “Rough Rode Ahead” a cyclist is pushed through an extremely harsh setting  trying to get to Yosemite National Park. In the story the narrator takes a trip to Yosemite National park after getting directions from two older men what the narrator doesn't know is that the road ahead is indeed rough. One narrator states “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated @NUM1). The narrator is really really taking a beating from the travel and this rocks, dry climate is really takens a tale. From reading this story the setting does not do any good for him other than the general store he finds in the end. Like the title states the setting of this story was a “Rough Road Ahead.”	2	2		2																						128	6	137	1	0	0	4.4728682170542635	21.5	38	17	9	6	1	12	65	10.4	8.36	7.16	12	9.2	10.08	12.4	11.5	180
3822	6218	3	There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town there wasn’t any real water he could drink. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty. Also, it’s the middle of June in California, it’s very hot and size and the is going to wear him out pretty quickly. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says “Over one long, crippling hill”, he’s saying the hills are very hard for him. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story.	2	1		2																						108	7	121	6	0	0	4.203703703703703	15.428571428571429	21	13	8	12	4	17	64	6.1	6.09	6.59	9	5.8	7.27	6.857142857142857	8.4	141
3826	6222	3	In this paragraph I will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One affect was the uneven, bumpy roads he was trying  to cycle on. If it was flat he wouldn’t have to really be more aware, cause with bumpy roads he has to look out for rocks, holes in the road. Another affect are the hills. He had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat. Those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						90	6	100	3	0	0	4.21978021978022	15.166666666666666	22	11	5	3	0	10	57	6.1	6.26	7.71	11	5.6	7.33	7.333333333333334	8.3	117
3828	6224	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist in many was it was like a crazy maze, the road he was own, and him not really knowing were he was going didn’t help him, or not having enough water.

3840	6236	3	The cyclist in the essay goes through phases that effect him differently according to the setting. At first the cyclist knows where he is and is very familiar with his location. He is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it. He then shows up at a “ghost town.” He begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him. This place was completely deserted and there was no water for him. He began to feel discouraged when he passed the Grape juice factory and he seriously believed this was the end for him. His hope and enjoyment finally returned to him after he saw the sign for the bait. The bikers feelings and attitude changed as often as the setting did.	2	2		2																						127	9	135	0	0	0	4.338582677165355	14.11111111111111	24	19	6	9	6	8	76	7.0	7.19	7.78	20	7.1	9.82	10.166666666666666	10.7	173

3851	6247	3	The harsh setting in “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit “by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to “Yosemite.”	3	2		3																						141	7	146	0	0	0	4.347517730496454	20.142857142857142	42	18	8	4	3	17	77	13.2	7.84	8.06	17	10.7	12.7	18.666666666666668	9.4	183
3853	6249	3	Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources – especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. “I was going to die” he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder.	3	3		3																						201	13	226	13	0	0	4.82089552238806	15.461538461538462	57	25	12	11	3	32	106	11.3	9.86	8.17	31	9.9	10.83	15.75	11.4	295
3864	6260	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in @CAPS1 ways. The cyclist was in California in June weather. If it wasn’t so hot, he wouldn’t have needed water as badly. He wouldn’t have been sweating as much. Also, there weren’t any buildings or cars around, so there wasn’t anyone to help him. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.” @CAPS1 features of the setting could affect the cyclist.	2	1		2																						77	6	89	6	0	0	4.597402597402597	12.833333333333334	24	8	2	6	2	18	43	7.9	7.94	7.48	9	6.9	6.68	6.9	5.7	105
3875	6271	3	The hot, dry, and baron setting affect the cyclist greatly. Baron is a hot, dry and abanded place. The cyclist is trying to ride his bike to Yosemite national park. He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake.”…Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades,”(Kurmaskie). The hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated.	2	2		2																						73	5	84	5	0	0	4.824324324324325	14.8	18	9	11	2	3	13	33	8.9	9.45	9.55	17	6.6	9.13	7.699999999999999	9.9	103

3886	6282	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, “Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven’t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. “This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se – a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist.	3	3		3																						194	13	212	3	0	0	4.2	15.0	54	27	12	6	4	26	103	6.5	6.32	7.94	27	6.1	7.72	10.6	7.5	254
3893	6289	3	The conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist. The conditions were that, he had to save as much water as possible and keep himself hydrated at the same time so that he wouldn’t dehydrate himself.The features of the desert like land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there. You can never predict what they’ll do.	2	1		2																						71	5	79	2	0	0	4.625	14.4	14	9	8	4	3	9	47	9.5	9.05	8.08	9	6.7	8.81	10.375	10.1	95
3895	6291	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn’t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist.	2	2		2																						96	6	104	2	0	0	4.09375	16.0	19	15	1	5	2	9	61	5.8	5.68	6.57	10	6.0	7.23	7.5	7.2	122
3901	6297	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope and nearly lead him to his death.	1	1		1																						81	6	89	1	0	0	4.506172839506172	13.5	18	11	10	1	3	7	43	6.6	7.76	7.23	11	6.2	6.88	6.916666666666667	9.3	112
3908	6304	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.	1	1		1																						61	5	66	0	0	0	4.229508196721311	12.2	12	8	7	3	1	4	39	4.6	5.9	6.05	5	4.5	6.85	5.9	8.2	81
3910	6306	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because, it is hot, and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle, hot and dry with bad directions, and in a desert is bad. It was a long distance ride, in the burning hot sun, with little water, and he thought he was going to die because there was nothing insight.	1	1		1																						63	2	72	7	0	0	4.174603174603175	31.5	13	6	9	0	4	9	36	14.0	6.69	7.2	8	12.0	13.87	17.25	0.0	83
3912	6308	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says “wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.” The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it.	3	3		3																						200	10	212	2	0	0	4.325	20.0	43	31	11	10	6	19	113	10.1	7.37	8.45	33	8.4	10.68	11.0	9.2	268
3916	6312	3	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist. He starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men. The cyclist is very excited about the thought of a short cut and is drinking his water effectliy. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him. He take pressure in thinking about the cool stress of @CAPS1 and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictious stream had an effect on the cyclist. Soon the sun starts to beat on him even more. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage. When he come over the bend he cave to his troubles road and thirst	1	2		2																						133	8	140	0	0	0	4.090225563909774	16.625	28	20	12	7	6	8	74	6.1	5.8	7.31	18	5.0	7.24	7.833333333333334	6.6	163
3917	6313	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. For example, the author states “looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. For instance in the text, “it didn’t really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.” This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. He would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.	3	2		3																						172	10	183	3	0	0	4.4476744186046515	17.2	38	27	14	8	4	16	99	10.3	8.07	8.01	20	9.3	11.16	12.0	11.0	237
3922	6318	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly in the story. The list desert climate tales damage onto the cyclist by quickly depleting his water supply. He also began to get worried when every town the old men told about turned out to be a ghost town. This crawled doubt in the cyclist mind that he might not survive the “shortcut” told off by the old men.	1	1		1																						68	4	72	0	0	0	4.382352941176471	17.0	19	10	4	3	0	5	34	7.7	7.48	8.19	11	6.4	7.39	7.75	6.0	90
3923	6319	3	The features in the setting effects the cyclist because there it different kinds of hills. He has watch out for rocks in the middle of the road. He has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert. There is no cars around but he still has to look for any cars in case they came out of nowhere. There is a lot of turns. It is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a neat scaoke. There is no places where he can stop because there is no shade. There is no stores where he can stop & get water and food at either. That is the setting of the cyclist.	1	1		1																						126	10	135	0	0	0	3.6825396825396823	12.6	25	19	5	5	3	9	88	3.0	3.18	5.84	3	2.8	5.56	6.285714285714286	5.0	141

For  example when the sign said ,â€� Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.â€� @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated .

3925	6321	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he could have tried  if he drunk the battery taste water. or if he didn’t get enough clean water on time. Driving a bike on in a long distance, with no water or any other supples is very energy consuming. So you have to plan trips like that very wisly.	1	1		1																						63	5	70	1	0	0	4.109375	12.8	17	8	5	4	2	9	36	6.0	5.97	8.43	11	5.9	8.22	7.625	8.1	84
3934	6330	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, “sometimes life can feel so cruel”, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically.

It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says “have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office” gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite.	2	2		2																						107	5	114	2	0	0	4.158878504672897	21.4	27	12	7	7	4	11	58	8.9	6.38	7.65	14	8.1	10.06	11.2	9.4	141
3956	6352	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says “I noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” This effects the cyclist because it makes him work harded when he is dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says”… in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting flustrated an there’s No cold water. This affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost. He didn’t have a good map.	2	2		2																						143	8	157	5	0	0	4.465277777777778	18.0	34	24	8	4	2	24	73	8.7	7.89	8.5	25	7.9	9.4	8.166666666666666	9.2	197

3966	6362	3	I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain. Some types are not always good for a bike rider because if it’s bumpy then someone could fall off the bike. Also, if it is dark you @MONTH1 not even be able to see where you are going then you could hurt your-self very seriously. That’s why riding a bike is dangerous. Also, if your in the type of enviroment where every thing is smooth then you @MONTH1 be able to have a nice bike ride.	1	1		1																						99	5	108	2	0	0	4.252525252525253	19.8	21	10	9	10	0	10	61	8.5	6.79	6.69	6	7.5	8.73	10.7	8.2	129

He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, “It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine.

Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, “Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence	3	3		3																						187	11	210	17	0	0	4.385026737967914	17.0	47	33	12	9	9	29	95	12.6	7.61	7.83	18	10.2	11.75	7.833333333333334	8.8	239

To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.	3	3		3																						184	10	207	10	0	0	4.782608695652174	18.4	48	25	15	10	9	28	94	11.3	9.63	8.51	27	8.9	10.55	8.666666666666666	10.0	252

And with no landmarks or places insight its hard to have confidence because theire is nothing to keep going for.	1	2		2																						62	2	67	3	0	0	4.741935483870968	31.0	16	8	6	1	5	6	34	16.4	10.34	9.76	12	13.0	14.34	17.0	0.0	86

4040	6436	3	The features of the setting been amajor affect of this cyclist  in the  story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but think is a lot like and winding. The cyclist also comes across bumps, non-paved roads that make it hard to meneuver through. Then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story.	2	1		2																						78	5	89	2	0	0	4.15	16.0	19	8	10	3	3	10	44	6.3	6.38	7.85	9	5.8	6.24	7.0	5.7	100

4042	6438	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because I was talking about the exceed posted speed limit. How the speed limit or were it says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. They are trying to say is that, you do what they say you are going to be mesem peoples travel will not work, so make the right choice and do the right thing.	1	1		1																						81	3	88	2	0	0	4.37037037037037	27.0	20	16	3	1	2	9	47	12.7	7.96	8.87	14	10.3	11.29	14.166666666666666	7.8	106
4047	6443	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For instance, If you were cycling in a very cold climate you wouldn’t sweat as much and wouldn’t need to drink as much water, but in the story the cyclist is in a very hot climate and he runs out of water, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sps,wide cings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realizating that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This quote explains that the setting of the cycling plays a huge role in the cyclist. Also, the terrain can affect biker. If one was to ride on a flat terrain is gonna put much wear…and tear on the cyclists body therefore the flat terrain would be easier. All of those reasons explains that the settings affect the cyclist in many  ways.	2	2		2																						149	6	164	5	0	0	4.223684210526316	25.333333333333332	40	20	14	7	5	15	81	13.7	7.85	8.51	21	11.4	12.73	26.0	7.6	195
4054	6450	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3.	2	2		2																						112	5	119	1	0	0	4.026785714285714	22.4	22	16	10	8	3	8	67	8.8	5.87	7.43	15	8.5	10.03	10.6	8.2	147
4069	6465	3	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically.	2	2		2																						79	5	85	0	0	0	4.772151898734177	15.8	22	7	3	6	7	4	46	8.9	9.74	7.22	11	8.3	8.35	8.5	10.4	116
4079	6475	3	The cyclist had very little water. It was very hot. He had a long way to go. The road was very bumpy so he couldn’t go to fast or he’s tire’s might bust. There were know cars in site so if he did break down it would have taken even longer.	1	1		1																						51	5	56	0	0	0	3.7058823529411766	10.2	7	11	5	5	1	8	32	1.1	2.18	6.93	1	1.4	4.08	4.1	3.1	56
4084	6480	3	The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective.” and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don’t have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist.	2	2		2																						177	10	197	8	0	0	4.242937853107344	17.7	34	26	13	14	7	22	111	13.3	7.21	7.15	13	11.3	13.38	29.5	10.9	228

4091	6487	3	In the selection “Do not exceed posted speed limit” there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn’t been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and “crippling hills,” according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn’t empty and deserted.	2	3		3																						148	6	161	8	0	0	4.52027027027027	24.666666666666668	28	25	10	10	4	18	84	12.2	8.71	8.6	23	10.6	11.77	11.4	11.5	204
4099	6495	3	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay “A sea worry “, because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says “my son body-surfs. He says it’s his “job”. That quote was explaining that he’s a body-surfer & it’s his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph.	1	2		2																						71	4	80	1	0	0	4.408450704225352	17.75	26	7	5	1	2	12	30	6.9	7.59	7.75	9	6.3	8.42	7.300000000000001	9.4	100
4100	6496	3	Condition the cyclist is in affect a lot of how they ride. One example of this is, “I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.” @CAPS1 to this fact the cyclist had went into a “dehydrated state” because of not having much water. When your travelling in hot weather areas without much water your body will become dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists diffently.	1	1		1																						71	4	76	1	0	0	4.957746478873239	17.75	20	10	5	1	0	10	37	10.8	10.61	7.63	14	10.2	11.06	11.375	12.2	112
4104	6500	3	In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in.	2	1		2																						74	4	82	4	0	0	4.054054054054054	18.5	16	10	3	5	5	8	45	6.9	5.63	6.9	8	8.1	7.94	9.0	8.1	100
4111	6507	3	The features of the setting affect the authors dispotion as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of the paragraph five the author writes that “I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water. This is similair to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay.	3	3		3																						191	9	204	5	0	0	4.43455497382199	21.22222222222222	47	22	14	11	2	18	108	11.4	8.3	8.62	33	10.3	11.86	12.2	10.4	262
4114	6510	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid.Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist.	2	1		2																						66	5	74	2	0	0	4.492537313432836	13.4	20	10	0	5	1	7	38	8.3	8.23	7.8	8	6.2	7.21	7.5	6.0	84
4117	6513	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).” This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his “shortcut” his running out of water. That’s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men.	2	2		2																						72	4	77	1	0	0	4.888888888888889	18.0	19	10	3	2	2	10	37	19.6	11.04	10.03	16	15.0	17.18	20.5	0.0	103
4118	6514	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily .On top of that he had to pedal a bicicle. So he was thirsty and tired prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																						57	6	62	0	0	0	4.0701754385964914	9.5	14	6	4	3	2	7	35	3.4	4.5	6.97	9	4.2	7.37	5.5	8.2	76
4120	6516	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn’t prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the “high deserts of colifornia in June” I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a “ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back” That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to “ease post” it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was “replaced by short, rolling hills” which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?"	3	3		3																						248	9	276	12	0	1	4.289156626506024	27.666666666666668	53	36	24	14	6	35	141	16.5	7.61	7.81	25	13.6	15.61	17.666666666666668	10.3	329

4146	6542	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit” the features of the setting affects the cyclist a great deal. Each feature causing the cyclist to act. For example, in reaching the ‘ramshackle shed’ the cyclist finds the water inusuable; which causes to conserve water and try to head for the next town. That action leads him deeper into the high deserts of California during June. Also as the terrain changes from flat road to short, rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every ‘shack or building he comes across for water. In this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot.	2	2		2																						143	7	154	2	0	0	4.685314685314685	20.428571428571427	44	21	8	4	3	17	67	10.9	9.46	8.62	24	8.9	9.56	8.166666666666666	8.0	195
4147	6543	3	The cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is about a great adventure gone bad. He has every thing he needs but some how it turns out bad. He get low on water & the setting is horrible. He is on his way from a camp ground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite river. He gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns & was running out of water then he came to a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He was pedeling over hills & becoming dehydrated when he tought he was going to die he came to a bait shop & got waiter & met an old guy who was going to give him direction & he decided he better stick to the map.

4148	6544	3	Heat, hills and ghost towns – all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, the heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke. He starts dinking more often, and nearly runs out of water. Next is the hills. They can take massive amounts of energy to climb. Which adds to his dehydration. Finally the ghost towns. They make his journey seem hopeless.

4170	6566	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the “town” The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp…” (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.	3	2		3																						130	11	152	5	0	0	4.507575757575758	12.0	35	22	8	7	3	25	67	6.1	7.35	7.74	17	5.5	6.57	6.0	8.6	177
4178	6575	3	The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the dessert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1. In conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which affects his entire journey.	3	2		3																						204	11	222	8	0	0	4.387254901960785	18.545454545454547	47	30	18	13	10	19	111	9.4	7.6	7.13	16	7.7	9.14	6.857142857142857	7.9	266
4185	6582	3	"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																						145	6	161	4	0	0	4.23448275862069	24.166666666666668	26	27	10	7	2	14	91	10.6	6.91	7.34	15	9.2	10.78	13.5	8.8	191

4218	6615	3	The cyclist and his journey in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit were impacted by the setting. The “deserts of California in June” caused him to be weary very easily. The terrain change from the flat road to hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT Exceed 55 mph. He could only go @NUM1. Finally, the large snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist. All of these features affected the cyclist in some way.	3	2		3																						98	6	106	1	0	0	4.448979591836735	16.333333333333332	27	14	4	6	1	10	52	7.7	7.71	8.15	17	7.3	9.79	8.666666666666666	10.1	135

4226	6623	3	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again.	2	2		2																						157	10	173	2	0	0	4.180124223602484	16.1	38	26	12	8	7	14	79	6.4	6.61	7.03	13	5.9	7.04	5.5	6.7	200
4229	6626	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, he was in the california desert in June.The heat and lack of water can cause people to become dehydrated,passout or even die.There are not many sources of water in the deserts.The terrain didn’t help him much either, hills use a lot of energy and  made him perspore,causing him to lose flood from his body.

4239	6636	3	The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist’s anger. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, “one ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” All of sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to becom frightened and neurotic. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, “the water wouldn’t cool down” and “it had the flavor of battery acid. The cyclist’s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought “had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting.	3	2		3																						152	6	168	11	0	0	4.723684210526316	25.333333333333332	44	25	9	1	6	29	73	16.0	10.05	9.82	25	12.8	14.0	14.75	12.0	211
4242	6639	3	The features of the setting that affect cyclist depends where they are located. In this story the feeling on “nothing and the desert around him and the heat gave him no hope”. It all depends on where you are cycling. “It didn’t really matter I was going to die.” This quote states his feelings on what was going on through his head while he was dieing of thirst. He felt nothing he was sure he was going to die until he found a sign of civilization that was near and he became better and his hope was raised.	2	2		2																						98	5	102	0	0	0	4.1938775510204085	19.6	18	17	3	2	4	9	60	10.6	6.97	7.27	9	9.3	10.62	13.0	8.1	125

4260	6657	3	"In the short story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story. In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike. Being unware of where he is on his journey the setting begins to really affect him. For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that ""The sight was troubling."" As he continues to California in June the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. For example he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" The quote shows because he is biking so long is looking water and there is not a town is sight he becomes weak and although he is at terminated to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in."	3	3		3																						184	7	196	1	0	0	4.282608695652174	26.285714285714285	36	30	9	8	8	11	110	11.9	7.49	8.12	24	11.2	12.26	11.2	10.6	252

For example, in the beginning he came across a deserted town so he was cautious. Next, he came across a fork in the road which was troubling to him. Then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined. Finally, his determination changed to relief where he reached Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey.	2	2		2																						108	6	118	4	0	0	4.796296296296297	18.0	31	15	3	5	3	13	58	10.2	9.63	8.92	21	8.0	9.79	8.666666666666666	10.1	153
4263	6660	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed Limit,” is about a man that follows some bad directions and in the middle of a desert is stuck without water. He starts to lack confidence in the directions when the setting changes. He said, “After fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.” He had been told this was a thriving town but was left with nothing. This was a big let down and the cyclist wasn’t so positive this had been the right choice. He keeps on riding and finds another dissetling sight.” One ramshacle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that wouldn’t  hold in the lamest of mule greeted me.“ @CAPS1 was another place said to be good but all he got was battery flavored water. On the last strech of his bike met with rough rolling hills, a diamondback looking snake, and an abandoned juice factory. All of this brang his spirits lower and lower until he thought he would die. The cyclist ended up finding a store but he was discauraged by the environment he was in a hot and could have died.	1	1		1																						201	9	218	8	0	0	4.400990099009901	22.444444444444443	46	30	17	3	10	28	106	12.0	8.01	8.57	30	9.5	11.43	14.0	10.1	267
4265	6662	3	Features of the setting such as the hot sun, no water, and “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp,” greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high desserts of California in June, the temperature was really high and the hot sun left “wide rings of dried sweat” on his shirt and made the cyclist realize that he could drop from a heatstroke. Also, the fact that the only water around felt “somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees” and “had the flavor of battery acid” prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a “dehydrated state.” @CAPS1, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp” affected the cyclist by solving his problem of dehydration, since there was cold water availible for him upon arrival.	2	2		2																						125	3	136	7	0	0	4.872	41.666666666666664	36	18	9	3	7	22	65	22.3	11.27	9.12	21	17.2	19.24	19.666666666666668	14.1	179
4268	6665	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways. He was biking in the middle of the summer in a very hot state of California. This affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated. The roads are very hilly so, he has to use alot more energy to get up the hills. That’s why I think the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed.”	2	1		2																						100	6	107	2	0	0	4.29	16.666666666666668	21	15	5	8	4	10	56	8.8	7.08	7.47	13	8.7	10.4	11.6	10.4	138
4279	6676	3	In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, “This sight was troubling,” he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die.	2	2		2																						119	4	128	7	0	0	4.218487394957983	29.75	26	22	5	5	4	13	65	18.3	7.27	8.39	10	15.2	15.88	17.666666666666668	9.7	149
4280	6677	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he had some troubles, the fact that there was not much civilization affected the cyclist because he was not able to refill his water bottles, so he grew very thirsty. Also, the many hills and the fact that it is summer impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast. When it says, “A tar like substance oozed out Wouldn’t cool down,” it showed how he wasn’t able to drink. Also, when he passed the grape juice factory, it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty. If he hadn’t taken the advice of the men in the first place he would have had a much shorter ride and would not have been so exhausted. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay.	3	3		3																						170	8	187	11	0	0	4.288235294117647	21.25	38	22	11	13	4	22	100	10.9	7.26	7.91	23	9.2	11.37	14.0	9.6	222
4287	6684	3	the setting affects the cyclist very strongly in the story because mentally and physically he wasn’t ready for where he was going. For example the text states “No a better, piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never. Accept traver advice from a collection of old timers who wasn’t left the cosines of theer poiches since calter was in office.” So a youg guy took maid advice from older guys about how to get to a pack backin thier day it probably was a shortcut.	1	1		1																						87	4	91	1	0	0	4.425287356321839	21.75	24	10	8	6	1	12	42	13.9	8.66	9.61	15	12.2	13.9	16.166666666666668	10.5	121
4294	6691	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if it’s raining or snowing it affects the cyclist because pavement can be wet and icy. Which causes the cyclist to slip and @DATE1 and the cyclist can really get injured. Also the cyclist has to wear a helmet if it’s very hot outside you wouldn’t see the cyclist in winter clothes. This would make the cyclist unfocus and the cyclist wouldn’t be able to finish any race.	1	1		1																						77	4	81	0	0	0	4.532467532467533	19.25	21	12	4	3	5	7	42	9.5	8.65	7.26	9	8.5	8.24	10.125	7.2	107
4297	6694	3	The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he’s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he’s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that there’s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved.	3	3		3																						159	6	178	12	0	0	4.723270440251572	26.5	27	24	14	13	9	23	90	14.1	9.64	8.23	21	11.3	12.61	12.0	11.5	220
4303	6700	3	The cyclist is affected by @NUM1 couple different things. First, he is given directions that are out of date and then he has to deal with the heat of the weather in the early summer of California. If that wasn’t enough, he then runs out of water, which he needs very badly. He runs into a couple more problems, like seeing a big snake and coming to a factory that used to make juice and it was now run down and empty. After all of these obsticles, the cyclist pulls through and makes it to @NUM1 fishing store, where he gets water.	2	2		2																						102	5	113	6	0	0	4.215686274509804	20.4	20	16	6	8	5	13	62	8.6	6.44	7.28	8	7.7	9.73	11.2	9.4	134
4316	6713	3	In this pasage the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been any were else he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the seting had botha lack of civillesation and water that he needed that caused him to almost faint of thirst. This is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist, “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” This showes that had all the setting been paridice he would never learned anything.	2	1		2																						87	4	92	2	0	0	4.494252873563219	21.75	18	11	2	5	3	13	58	14.2	9.01	8.34	11	11.1	14.36	16.5	11.2	114

When the cyclist got directions to Yosemite from these two ??? old people, he thought he was getting a good shortcut. In reality, he was just led on a road that seemed to head nowhere where he saw many things that added to his feeling of hopelessness, for example, the author writes, “ I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds crossed my path and an adversely large snake. It really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This shows that the cyclist is getting tired and seeing tumbleweeds, which usually represents a phase being completely deserted and deadly snakes that get in his way.

4373	6770	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhausting. The heat @MONTH1 cause the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal. This is especially true in this case because of his lack of water. The cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke. The terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road. His muscle will start to ocha and his body will need water and rest. The story would totaly change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the @DATE1 on a cold day in the mid @NUM1 he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke. There would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything.	2	2		2																						155	10	167	0	0	0	4.483870967741935	15.5	36	16	12	8	6	14	90	7.4	7.89	7.46	18	7.0	8.01	6.857142857142857	9.4	210

Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclist’s will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. The features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going	3	2		3																						178	8	198	13	0	0	4.550561797752809	22.25	37	34	9	15	8	22	102	11.1	8.77	7.67	22	9.6	10.94	11.6	10.7	246
4404	6801	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water begins to take a toll of how fast he can get to the next town. Another example would be the terrain only slows him down more.	1	1		1																						43	3	46	0	0	0	4.046511627906977	14.333333333333334	11	5	2	3	0	3	28	4.8	5.21	8.02	6	5.3	6.65	7.166666666666666	8.8	57
4406	6803	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it more difficult to ride. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” “a large highway sign jumped out atm.” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit.” “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The fact the it was such a hot day made the ride seem longer. When out of water you feel exostied. You will do just about anything to try to with stand the heat.	2	1		2																						90	5	96	1	0	0	4.366666666666666	18.0	22	17	6	5	0	16	43	14.2	7.9	7.93	11	10.3	12.44	15.333333333333334	6.4	111
4415	6812	3	The raugher the road gets for him the more determination he has at the beginning towards the end he had the mind set that, “it didn’t matter it was going to die, “this took a toll on him and it was hard to go on. He realyed he didn’t want to die that way and so he kept on, eventually leading to civilisation.	1	1		1																						63	3	68	3	0	0	3.9206349206349205	21.0	11	13	3	2	2	10	37	12.8	5.58	7.71	6	12.0	14.5	17.75	0.0	83
4417	6814	3	Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a group of old guys and ends up lost on rough road with no water, or relylittic supply of flat road was replaced by short rolling hills large highways lon jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” The rough road made have to work harder want more water and just made things tougher more than what they already were.	2	2		2																						99	4	107	2	0	0	4.343434343434343	24.75	28	17	11	5	3	9	44	15.5	7.9	9.1	14	12.6	14.41	17.5	8.8	125
4418	6815	3	The settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood. Take for instance the cycler. In the beginning he had a positive attitude but once he arrived at the first town his attitude started to go down from there. He explains describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” Ghost towns come across very old, run down and dull. That affected the cyclist because by it not being like the old men said he was becoming doubtful, which in turn doesn’t give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when he get to what is suppose to be water and a, “tar like substance oozed out.” That makes him nevers and mad because he isn’t sure he will make it. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store. The setting becomes positive and so does he. So, the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude.	2	2		2																						169	10	183	5	0	0	4.378698224852071	16.9	33	28	11	10	7	20	101	8.6	7.54	7.56	22	7.1	9.18	11.8	10.0	228
4423	6820	3	The cyclist of this story is greatly affected by the heat of his souroundings. While he riding to @CAPS1, the heat of the day began to increase. The text reads “ I had been hitting my water bootle regulary. “@CAPS2 to the heat of the day, the cyclist was down to his water consuming large patterns of it at a time.

4425	6822	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he’s fine. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn’t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, “It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” he knows that things are going to get rough, because “the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph”. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn’t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, “tumble weeds crossed my path.” The landscape seems to get more threatening too, “a ridiculously large shake.” The landscape changes with the state of water."	3	3		3																						206	13	238	14	0	0	4.334951456310679	15.846153846153847	44	37	15	14	7	37	118	9.3	6.85	7.88	20	7.8	9.6	10.4	7.9	259
4427	6824	3	the features of setting that the cyclist run into does affect him. For example when the setting changes from abandoned town to an empty deserted rond that no been on in thirty years; gives a cyclist less motivation him self to go on and even less strength.	1	1		1																						47	3	50	0	0	0	4.468085106382978	15.666666666666666	13	5	4	2	1	3	28	11.4	8.54	8.83	7	10.1	11.95	13.25	0.0	64
4432	6829	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much in this. The hot weather made him have a dry mouth leading to the lack of water. He used stones in his mouth and he said, “I’d read once that sucking of stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.""

4442	6839	3	The setting that affect the cyclist is the condition of the road because the road turns all different ways and the road goes up hill so it makes it harder to go up the road the cyclist has @NUM1 miles befor he gets to a town he could run out of water. If he run out of water befor he gets there, he might have to make stops so he doesn’t make hisself sick. When he gets to the town he can get more water.	1	1		1																						85	4	89	1	0	0	3.764705882352941	21.25	17	16	4	1	1	5	51	10.4	4.53	7.83	6	9.6	11.79	14.833333333333334	7.8	102
4446	6843	3	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist & his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,“and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place. Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert. that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced.	1	1		1																						127	6	147	13	0	0	4.708661417322834	21.166666666666668	28	11	17	4	3	22	71	13.5	9.46	7.77	19	10.8	11.67	11.4	10.8	174
4466	6863	3	How the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads, rolling hill, and the?? heat. The conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough. An example firm the texted is “ I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short ralling hills. These condition make is hard for the cycled it gives him a challenge.  The rolling hills challange him a regret to stay on the road it is easly tricky and challenges so was The heat & sun was also played an affection on the cyclist. An Examples from the @CAPS1 is.” I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat doing but I barely not ???. the sun was not starting to get him  ?? sharply ??  It will start to get ????? when is ?? is high deserts. I conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways but he keep pushing himself to more on.	3	2		3																						173	14	200	3	0	16	4.2272727272727275	12.571428571428571	40	27	9	8	6	21	94	9.9	7.37	8.64	27	7.9	9.8	8.166666666666666	8.8	224
4474	6871	3	The terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big affect on them. The first example of this is in they are riding on hills, it makes it much harder for them. For example when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to ride on hills he was, olcasly disappointed. Another thing that affects cyclist is the smothness of the road they are riding on. In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the main character came to rough spot in the road and was disappointed and didn’t want to ride it. Another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat. Several times in the story, the cyclists says that he is tired and dehydrated, at one point he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke. Those are the effects of the rider’s setting have on him/her.	2	2		2																						148	8	163	4	0	0	4.236486486486487	18.5	32	23	7	4	4	18	88	7.8	6.73	7.43	18	7.0	8.48	11.2	9.2	198
4477	6874	3	The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water. He did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him. Being in that situation and setting I would have given up.	2	2		2																						69	6	76	1	0	0	4.318840579710145	11.5	13	10	3	3	4	7	45	4.7	6.01	6.95	8	4.2	6.92	5.416666666666667	7.8	93
4485	6882	3	The @CAPS1 is affected in many ways. The major thing that effects him is the lack of water. Throughout the story he mentions the lack of water. He also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route. For example, “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off thire porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” The @CAPS1 says things about the older gentle man throughout the story.	2	2		2																						85	5	92	2	0	0	4.423529411764706	17.0	22	12	5	1	0	10	48	7.9	7.42	8.19	11	6.4	8.21	8.3	8.2	113
4486	6883	3	Setting very much affects the cyclist and now he feels. If he was in a bad setting then he would most likely be in a bad mood. Mood is highly affected by the general setting. In the essay “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist feels very confiedent of himself and the setting helps to boost that confiedence and andorence.	1	1		1																						64	4	69	0	0	0	4.453125	16.0	15	8	3	9	3	9	34	7.5	7.83	8.13	11	6.0	7.03	7.5	7.2	85
4487	6884	3	The features in the setting of the essay affected the author greatly. The Hills, on a hot day, with no water, or nearby town is really rough, expecially if you’ve been riding for more than @NUM1 miles. The environment of the hot June weather near a dessert area can cause serious problems, for example heat stroke and since he had no water to drink dehydration caused a lot of fear in the author. The setting of the essay and the conditions the author were under were extreamly dangerous and hes lucky he made it out alive.	2	2		2																						96	4	106	5	0	0	4.458333333333333	24.0	28	8	10	4	4	12	51	11.6	8.25	8.28	12	10.3	12.93	14.5	12.2	135
4489	6886	3	In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of, old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their parches since carter was in office, “and quickly realized that he shouldn’t have. The author describes the setting of the first “town” as, “the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This didn’t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and corral that couldn’t hold in the largest mule.” Was what met him there. The cyclist said that “this sight was troubling.” It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This short story shows how anything can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival.	2	2		2																						166	11	185	9	0	0	4.728915662650603	15.090909090909092	42	23	14	8	2	34	83	14.7	9.64	8.53	23	11.7	12.53	14.25	10.1	226
4498	6895	3	In the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy torns. Also, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people which made him fell alone and life he was going to die. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story “Over onelong, crippling hill a building came into view! This quote shows how the hills in the seting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						121	8	132	3	1	0	4.305785123966942	15.125	30	15	11	7	5	12	70	7.5	6.84	7.23	14	6.5	7.91	7.833333333333334	7.4	158
4504	6901	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he’s in the middle of nowhere with no water. The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” This quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car.	2	1		2																						100	7	105	0	0	0	4.39	14.285714285714286	24	16	5	7	0	11	55	15.9	8.19	8.29	10	13.9	14.52	18.333333333333332	10.5	137
4509	6907	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if they weren’t hills and rough roads, he would of been able to get to yosemite park faster and he wouldn’t of ran out of water.	1	1		1																						35	1	37	1	0	0	4.257142857142857	35.0	8	5	2	2	2	4	20	16.1	7.67	9.88	3	12.2	14.0	17.5	0.0	42
4511	6909	3	In my opinion the features of the selling affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he was talking abut the terair changing from long strat roads to shard winday one and the speed limit changing he said.he was doing a waterdepleting @NUM1 fuier sands like he is having a hard time, or doesn'twnt to go on.	1	1		1																						58	2	62	2	0	0	4.431034482758621	29.0	16	8	5	0	2	11	29	13.9	8.31	11.06	13	11.1	12.98	15.5	0.0	78
4512	6910	3	Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, “…The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him.	2	2		2																						145	5	160	5	0	0	4.657534246575342	29.2	38	19	8	4	4	16	76	15.2	9.93	8.23	20	12.2	13.81	15.5	13.0	208
4519	6917	3	In the essay “Rough road ahead: do not exeed posted speed limit,” the author is continually depressed, by the features of the landscape he passes. At first he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water, this sight doesn’t bothe him. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a “rusted water pump,” and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path then he passes an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. The setting its features serve to dissappoint depress the cyclist in his quest to find water.	3	2		3																						122	6	132	6	0	0	4.459016393442623	20.333333333333332	27	23	7	6	5	16	64	11.8	8.3	8.34	18	9.3	10.42	13.0	7.6	163
4523	6921	3	Poor directions heat, and lack of water affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is confident in the directions which would, “slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.”  As the story progresses, the cyclist is no longer so confident. The “heat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.” I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was near heat stroke. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him. His perseverance paid off. “Then , as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. The cyclist had found a barst shop and recteved water.	3	3		3																						176	9	197	13	0	0	4.553672316384181	19.666666666666668	53	17	10	10	5	31	89	14.8	9.18	8.78	26	12.3	14.42	20.333333333333332	12.5	251
4535	6933	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind. She didn’t knew where she was and on hip of that got lost. Whether you see nothing around. You or alot around you, you’re going to feel scared. They have the same affect. In the authors case, she was cycling and didn’t/couldn’t and water. This is an over whelming feeling because you can die from dehydration. She then kept cycling and saw nothing. “no one insight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” That is alatining no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die. These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They dffinately affected the cyclist because she was by herself, and on her dvun. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike and an empty water bottle.	3	2		3																						147	12	170	8	0	0	4.428571428571429	12.25	31	22	4	5	10	29	93	6.1	6.89	6.99	15	5.0	6.45	5.625	7.0	193
4542	6940	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road:Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit”by Joe kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way.It begins slowly with the “ghost town”.The narrorator “chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,” he wasn’t especially worried,but the fact he checked his water suggests that he’ll need to ration it for a while.The decline continues when he reaches the fock and the “ramshackle shed.”@CAPS1 the description of the place shows you he did not like it,and he confirms that with the words,“this sight was troubling.”He wouldn’t be replenishing his water here.Any more of this he’d be dead,either from dehydration or from pessimism.Eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea.This is ironics,he only going 12 mph to put it in his own words,“sometimes life can be so cruel.”He quite obviously hates the setting,and it’s all the fault of the setting.	3	2		3																						154	6	178	9	0	0	4.911949685534591	26.5	41	24	8	9	7	32	86	79.4	12.56	16.3	31	62.2	64.2	60.0	0.0	230
4545	6943	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist.	1	1		1																						99	6	107	2	0	0	4.373737373737374	16.5	24	10	9	3	1	8	61	7.4	7.31	7.33	14	7.4	8.22	8.083333333333334	8.3	135
4547	6945	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening. His water supply got drank quickly and he couldn’t find a town near. He was in the desert-like California, and the sun was beating down on him. When he did one town, it was more of a “ghost town”, and had rusted pumps that had battery-oil tasting liquid. Every person he asked told him is near, but from dehydration, it took him longer. the roads got windy and small hills occurred. There was a large snack in the middle of the road, as the tumble weed blew by. the finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down.	2	2		2																						119	8	137	6	0	0	4.260504201680672	14.875	30	21	9	4	7	18	63	8.5	6.67	7.8	13	7.5	9.26	8.333333333333334	9.3	154
4555	6953	3	The setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really goes against the cycilist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page @NUM1 it says, “a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn’t cool down,” This explains how bad the water was when the cycilist was there.	1	1		1																						75	4	81	4	0	0	4.306666666666667	18.75	21	10	3	4	5	14	41	11.4	7.38	7.82	8	9.5	10.53	13.5	8.8	98
4558	6956	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water.

4560	6958	3	In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it’s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It’s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn’t take the old mans advice.	3	2		3																						118	9	132	5	0	0	4.466101694915254	13.11111111111111	29	18	4	10	2	16	69	6.2	7.06	7.9	13	6.0	7.27	6.375	9.4	162
4562	6960	3	I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, “I could drop from heatstroke”. Meaning, its really hot! Also, l think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him because it says in the passage, “l eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. This has a big affect on him, because he’s very thirsty. Also, l think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars. I think all these things affect him.	2	2		2																						115	7	130	8	1	0	4.3652173913043475	16.428571428571427	21	23	4	8	0	18	67	5.5	6.31	6.74	12	4.7	6.16	5.875	7.4	150
4569	6967	3	"In the essay “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."	3	2		3																						170	13	188	5	0	0	4.6	13.076923076923077	38	27	16	8	5	23	97	7.3	8.11	7.68	23	6.5	7.33	10.8	8.8	234

This means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused.

4586	6984	3	The setting affect of a cyclist can be petty complicated. So many things has to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up have to be prepared for the weather. For example when there is serious weather conditions like rain,snow you have to careful of ley roads.Also they have to be prepared for is long riais. Some naes might be from @NUM1 miles the have to bring plenty of food and water. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike. For instance he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going cooperate. Also if work need's to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on.Also another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist is in shape. For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint.	1	1		1																						184	13	210	1	0	0	4.188172043010753	14.307692307692308	44	26	13	10	2	17	121	6.9	6.38	6.95	17	7.4	8.42	7.142857142857142	9.8	253
4587	6985	3	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.	1	1		1																						71	4	75	0	0	0	4.394366197183099	17.75	20	10	3	2	1	8	40	8.1	7.6	7.19	9	6.7	7.12	7.875	3.1	94
4595	6993	3	The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was riding through the deserts in June. The cyclist barely had water at the end of the stony. A lot of buidings were abandoned, right when he needed water.

4602	7000	3	To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was given very old directions. He was given back roads that are abandoned now. These towns had no people in them normally that would not matter, but he “was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” (@NUM1). If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A “ghost town” with no good water could have killed him. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them.	2	2		2																						105	7	120	6	0	0	4.561904761904762	15.0	24	16	6	3	6	18	60	7.5	7.59	7.69	13	5.6	8.67	7.142857142857142	8.8	138
4604	7002	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist runs into a couple obstacles and they affected him in many ways. In the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles. “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state.” This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had tumbleweed, a snake and he was dehydrated. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration. All through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well.	2	2		2																						112	7	121	2	0	0	4.517857142857143	16.0	28	16	4	6	5	13	65	11.1	8.54	8.41	17	9.7	12.17	12.0	11.6	157
4622	7020	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”, California’s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exguasted and dehydrated.	2	3		3																						207	8	227	12	0	0	4.478260869565218	25.875	50	27	13	13	10	23	121	12.6	8.42	6.9	19	11.0	11.52	15.5	11.7	290
4632	7030	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. “... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist.	1	1		1																						75	5	82	1	0	0	4.653333333333333	15.0	20	8	7	1	1	9	42	8.0	8.34	7.75	12	6.8	6.53	7.1	7.6	102
4636	7034	3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .” The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,” In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.	3	2		3																						163	9	178	8	0	0	4.7607361963190185	18.11111111111111	45	23	11	9	5	20	84	12.6	9.99	9.05	28	10.0	12.02	14.5	10.9	225
4637	7035	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First the climate affected him the most thats so because he became to hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated. So he had no energy because of dehydration. Another one is the built of the road. That’s so because it was rocky bumpy, winding, hills with being dehydrated the road was very tempting to just give up and die. Then the heat got him because there was no shade, no water left, and the sun just beating down on him.	2	2		2																						92	6	105	6	0	0	4.336956521739131	15.333333333333334	18	15	5	9	3	13	61	6.7	6.55	6.8	9	5.7	7.86	7.833333333333334	9.3	124

4641	7039	3	The main features that affected the cyclist were the ruff terrain and the hot sun. The rough terrain made it harder to pedal and it tired the cyclist out faster. But also helping was the hot sun because it would dehydrate him while he was riding. So between the hard to pedal rough terrain and the dehydratiog hot sun, the cyclist was very affect to the point of exausition.	1	1		1																						69	4	74	1	0	0	4.434782608695652	17.25	15	8	8	4	4	6	38	8.1	7.71	7.7	11	7.7	9.24	8.625	8.8	95
4645	7043	3	The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many way. It was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty. For example, “The sun was beginning to heat down” (pg @NUM1). So the sun is very exhusting and made him to start dehydrating. Another example is a traveling through the desert of California in June” (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state and June is one of it’s warmer months. The terrain didn’t favor in the riders either “Flat road had turned into, short rolling hills “(pg @NUM2). Short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain. This is how the setting affected the rider.	2	2		2																						113	9	129	2	0	0	4.486725663716814	12.555555555555555	36	10	12	4	3	19	54	6.0	6.83	7.48	11	5.8	7.52	6.625	9.7	156
4646	7044	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert.

4651	7049	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worse problems and couldnt really do anything about them. also, he started out fine, then he started to become dehydrated. He didnt have much water left and he was only @NUM1 miles up the road. a loss of water was very affective in June traveling through a desert. also, the damage of the road was very affective too because hes on a bike and not too good of balance. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, temperature, loss of water, road damages and snakes. the cyclist was on a bike and couldnt really protect himself, and he was dehydrated, and tired.	2	1		2																						122	8	143	9	1	0	4.590163934426229	15.25	28	14	8	12	7	17	76	15.4	9.06	8.0	16	14.0	14.5	14.75	12.6	177

4661	7059	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in “high desert of California in June.” This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																						120	10	133	3	0	0	4.383333333333334	12.0	25	20	9	9	4	14	76	5.2	6.6	6.99	17	4.4	6.13	5.333333333333333	8.2	161
4670	7068	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died.	2	1		2																						83	7	91	1	0	0	4.180722891566265	11.857142857142858	17	13	4	3	4	8	54	4.2	5.5	5.75	5	4.4	5.72	5.357142857142857	6.9	107
4672	7070	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.	1	1		1																						85	5	90	0	0	0	4.176470588235294	17.0	17	9	2	6	2	5	57	6.8	6.32	6.34	8	6.4	9.15	8.9	9.9	111
4675	7073	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, “by Joe Kurmaskie had many obsticales to over come. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, “@CAPS1 my gosh, what did I get myself into?!” Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in.	2	2		2																						143	6	156	7	1	1	4.363636363636363	23.833333333333332	34	23	8	6	4	19	80	11.0	7.67	7.91	22	10.2	11.48	13.75	10.1	200

This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert.

4684	7082	3	The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was “going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch’s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy.

He said, “what I shouldn’t have done was to let them see my map"".  Another problem he faced was when he began to run out of water.  This caused a problem to him because of dehydration. In the story he said, “The water bottle contained any a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1, another problem he encountered was the desert area that he was riding through. This caused problem for him because there wasn’t anybody around to help him if he needed it.

4698	7096	3	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since carter was in office.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers “shortcut” and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible.	2	2		2																						139	9	155	4	1	0	4.719424460431655	15.444444444444445	41	22	8	5	5	23	66	9.5	8.99	8.48	23	7.7	9.26	7.571428571428571	9.8	199

4703	7101	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how everychange happened. For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldn’t feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.	1	1		1																						63	4	67	0	0	0	4.444444444444445	15.75	12	8	6	6	3	5	36	7.4	7.83	6.68	5	7.1	6.95	8.375	10.1	88
4705	7103	3	Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesn’t have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would’ve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, don’t use a bike in the desert, its not to smart.	1	2		2																						147	9	167	10	0	0	3.9183673469387754	16.333333333333332	29	21	10	11	7	24	100	5.2	4.35	6.38	8	4.9	7.34	7.0	7.8	176
4706	7104	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because when all the cyclist is worried about is finding a place with water all he’s doing is getting scared and panicing. In other words, when he’s looking around, the setting he sees is like desert and no buildings. The story says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” when he sees that he panics and thinks he’s not gonna make it which affects him mentally.	1	1		1																						78	3	85	3	0	0	4.602564102564102	26.0	15	15	4	4	3	9	42	13.2	9.29	9.18	13	9.9	11.94	14.0	8.8	104
4711	7109	3	Features of any setting affect what you do and how you do it. Features affect the cyclist by water, help, and saftey. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing what spit you have to circulate.” This quote so his desperate need for water by saying he sucks a on rock to drink his own spit. The rough terrain and abandoned road the old men sent him on that was out of date, made him unable to ask for directions, and to even know if he is travelling correctly. Along the road he meets a snake. Being so far away from civilization, if he was to have gotten bit then he would have no one to help save him from dyeing on the side of the road. Also, if he was to have a heatstroke he has no water and no help. Safty, help, and water are all factors which contribute to the features, and how they effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						167	9	184	9	0	0	4.095808383233533	18.555555555555557	37	29	6	9	7	18	102	9.8	6.16	7.56	21	7.9	11.48	14.0	9.2	208
4713	7111	3	The cyclist’s features around him affected him negatively. He was cycling through “the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His water bottle was slowly running outand the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like batteryacid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states “Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.	3	3		3																						142	9	161	3	0	0	5.076923076923077	15.88888888888889	39	24	10	11	4	21	65	10.5	11.13	7.76	19	8.3	8.86	7.571428571428571	10.5	215

4749	7147	3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water “to feel sorry for himself” The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to “rolling hills”. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist.	3	2		3																						171	12	187	6	0	0	4.8011695906432745	14.25	44	30	15	11	2	23	83	8.4	9.5	8.33	30	7.6	8.5	6.375	9.7	249

These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldn’t get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake.” They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted “I eased past.” When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist’s journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other “GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, we’re your BEST BET.""The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect.

4757	7155	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who haden’t gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldn’t get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip.	2	3		3																						145	8	154	1	0	0	4.23448275862069	18.125	31	18	11	10	1	12	85	7.6	6.55	6.82	12	6.8	9.17	8.166666666666666	8.8	182

This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant” which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation.	2	2		2																						105	5	114	4	0	0	4.59047619047619	21.0	26	11	5	11	7	13	69	10.7	8.82	7.23	10	7.9	9.16	10.4	7.6	134

8886	14836	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was that the dirigible would have to be held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the building's frame in order to make the frame or sturdy, there was modifications to the building's framework which cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was the dirigible's use of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Since New York was a densely populated area, this would not work out well. The dirigibles would also have to be weighted down in the back with lead weights. In order to do so, the lead weights would end up dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was a safety issue one last obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area.	3	4		4																						166	8	180	3	0	0	4.656626506024097	20.75	46	22	8	10	2	12	96	12.4	9.52	8.14	28	10.2	12.13	12.4	11.5	232

After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were displayed by the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"". The result of the expirament were that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass.

Following that they told @LOCATION1 how Hindenburg by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there.	3	3		3																						114	9	123	0	0	0	4.842105263157895	12.666666666666666	30	18	11	2	1	12	56	7.7	9.38	8.7	19	5.9	8.24	7.0	10.3	158
8894	14844	6	The Empire State Building's docking zone was a magnificent and novel idea when it was first concieved but it was too difficult to implement. Al Smith, who spearheaded the operation, was too over anxious to complete it. Since not enough time was devoted to researching the risk's and structure of the dock, the plan to mount it on top the Empire State Building was already a failure.       Before the construction even began, trouble started to brew. The building couldn't withstand the stress of the @DATE1 foot long dirigible. The shock to the building would have transmitted tremendous pressure to the foundation. So the roof would have to be re-done in order for it to be structurally sound. After many months and @NUM1 dollars, the creation of the landing dock could begin.       Life is precious, and the landing dock was too volatile and dangerous to be used. The architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen not helium. Hydrogen is extremely Flammable. In @LOCATION1, the Hindenburg, which was constructed using hydrogen caught aflame and killed hundreds. There was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area. The idea was ostentatious and showy but because it was rushed, precautions were not taken into account. The obstacles that faced the docking station were too much, so finally the plan to erect it was abandoned.	3	3		3																						233	15	265	10	0	0	4.957446808510638	15.666666666666666	59	33	20	17	9	30	133	10.8	10.32	9.06	48	9.1	11.11	9.0	11.4	348

An obstacle as well that came with these dirigibles was all the time and effort they had to put in to learn how to safely install a mooring mast.

The mask made to made nature a danger to the whole building because of violent air current. Another reason how the Empire State Building failed is because their was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas.

In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: @CAPS1 building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the @LOCATION1. If the highly flamable helium inside the dirigibles then it would be putting thousands of peoples lives in jeopardy. Finally the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp.

The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation.	3	3		3																						141	7	153	0	0	0	4.9787234042553195	20.142857142857142	38	20	12	4	0	10	81	12.1	11.08	8.66	27	9.9	11.73	10.5	12.3	210

This job was not an easy thing to accomplish, it's not as simple as it might sound. If the builders added a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame.

There was also a law against airships driving too low and this would enable them from being able to dock. Also since other dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, it could easily cause a fire.

The Mooring @CAPS1 project came to a hault in the late 1930s, in order to keep the people of downtown New York City safe.	3	3		3																						150	8	162	4	0	0	4.886666666666667	18.75	50	17	15	6	1	14	71	11.0	10.5	8.78	29	9.4	11.25	13.2	12.2	225

On the expert it states, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."". If anyone disobayed this law it may result in punishment; as a result, it would create a new obstacle the builders would have to deal with.Last but not least, the idea of docking airships to a building is extremely unsafe.

If a disaster ever took place, many lifes would have been lost or severely injuried.

There were many things that could go wrong such as, the blimp hitting a spire and killing all the people below.The Greatest obstacle was nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast it would get wraped around the building, or just getting to the mooring would be difficult because of the wind.Overall the mooring mast was not a practical Idea.

Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.

Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking.

9224	15174	6	The Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles serverely affected the building attemp of the dirigible dock. For instance, The Empire State building is located in a very dense urban location. At the time most dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen insted of Helium. The main difference between the two was that Hydrogen is more flamable then Helium. So if the Hydrogen from the dirigible was to ignit then a castistrophic fire would arise. The effects could be as devistating as the Hindenburg which ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The result of the Hindenburg accident forced the architectures and enginners to look for a safer, alternate solution. Explosive gases were not the only problem though. Strong, gustful winds were present at the top of the Empire State Building. If winds were to blow a docking dirigible offcourse then the outcome would be deadly. If the dirigibles caught fire or were blown offcourse will docking then the pedistrians on the ground level could be injured.	2	3		3																						177	12	194	5	0	0	5.090395480225989	14.75	54	19	17	10	2	23	88	9.9	11.07	8.65	39	9.1	10.44	9.0	12.5	281
9226	15176	6	There were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that the dirigible hanging by one cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. This stress would cause the buildings foundation to crack. This obstacle caused the architects to have to strengthen the foundation, this cost them over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another obstacle was they had to make another floor which would be used for passengers and would let elevators bring the passengers to the eighty-sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be located. These observation areas were to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once this was done, they then had complete the roof before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Another obstacle was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were always shifting and the dirigibles, that usually land in open fields, could be weighted down with lead weights, but could not be used at the Empire State Building, where they would be hanging over pedestrians on the streets. Another obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for dirigible to tie up or even approach the Empire State Building. All these many obstacles led to the ideas of dirigibles and mooring mast, for the dirigibles had dissapeared.	3	4		4																						236	11	259	10	0	0	4.987288135593221	21.454545454545453	64	33	11	7	6	21	138	12.8	11.08	7.71	37	10.5	11.31	13.2	12.9	351

One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The greater obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The dirigible couldn't do anything even if tethered it to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.	2	2		2																						99	4	106	2	0	0	4.6767676767676765	24.75	32	10	6	3	1	7	55	13.0	9.75	9.17	19	10.6	13.15	14.875	12.2	140
9229	15179	6	The installation of a mooring mass on top of the Empire State building would have made the building, as well as the city of New York, incredibly important to modern travel in the 1930s. Alas, many difficult obstacles made the mast impossible to complete. First, to get the mast to the top, the buildings frame had to be strengthened and reinforced, which was painstaking and expensive. Second, the builders had to deal with the possibility of the blimps exploding. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. With constantly shifting, violent winds at the top of the building, the zeppelin would sway and swivel around the mast, making it difficult and dangerous to unload passengers. With high winds, the zeppelin could even detach from its mooring and fall onto the city below, potentially killing hundreds. Lastly, the builders failed to take into account the law that forbade dirigibles to fly too close to urban areas. This law made it illegal for any blimp to get near the Empire State Building, let alone dock on it. The thought of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a fantastic idea, albeit one destined to fail from the beginning.	4	4		4																						197	10	222	15	0	0	4.873096446700508	19.7	54	28	16	12	5	23	103	11.4	10.27	8.62	38	8.6	11.13	10.666666666666666	11.6	285

9241	15191	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a density populated area and you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast the reality. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building. Therefore, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed.	3	3		3																						163	5	175	6	0	0	4.865030674846626	32.6	42	17	13	8	6	9	96	17.8	11.09	8.26	23	14.8	16.72	21.666666666666668	15.9	251
9242	15192	6	The dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building for obvious reasons. When the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was having a dirigible landing on the top of the building. There were a few cautions that the workers realized. First off, if the dirigible catches on fire like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot of people would be at risk because it is such a big city with massive amounts of people. Another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds. If they tried landing there, but the violent winds wouldn't let them, then it would not be the least bit safe. This is how the workers of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.	2	2		2																						150	7	165	6	0	0	4.546666666666667	21.428571428571427	38	13	14	9	1	13	91	10.7	8.53	7.12	18	9.3	10.96	12.2	11.8	212

In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not adressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location.

For example the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top it. Also the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable so an accident above an urban area thats highly popuated would have been costly/fatal. Another obstacle was the wind, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building unpractical and unsafe.	3	3		3																						106	4	115	2	0	0	5.10377358490566	26.5	29	11	11	6	2	7	57	15.8	12.25	9.87	25	13.6	15.51	17.0	15.6	173

As with any vehicle in the air or at sea, wind is either your enemy, or your friend. The engineers should have taken into greater consideration that changing wind speeds and direction 1,250 feet in the air are huge threats. Your dirigible will have a hard time getting close enough to the mast to moor, never mind to stay steady enough for passengers to exit, and board safely. Also if the law itsself prevented you from floating your blimp at such low altitudes, then its game over. Why even bother if its illegal? Although it seems like a futuristic sci-fi, and not to mention downright cool way to land a blimp, to many things prevented the idea from prevailing.	2	2		2																						141	7	158	9	0	1	4.773049645390071	20.142857142857142	36	19	13	9	7	17	72	11.1	9.69	8.66	23	8.8	11.73	12.4	12.0	202

As in the article, the ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was unsafe for both passengers of the dirigible and pedestrians below to be close to the blimp and the turbulent air. Also, the flammability of the hydrogen in the blimp caused a problem; it was very unsafe to have a possible fire hazard that was @NUM1 feet long, floating close over a very populated place such as New York City. In addition to that, laws that airships could not fly too close over urban areas prohibited dirigibles even coming close to the mooring mast over the Empire State Building. A test run with the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles proved that it was too dangerous and impractical; the dirigible could not even get close enough to tie up.

From the very beginning of it's construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped the record for the highest building.	3	3		3																						178	9	201	10	0	0	5.00561797752809	19.77777777777778	58	22	9	10	5	20	93	12.1	10.97	8.79	34	9.8	11.52	13.2	12.7	265

At that time, it was the law that you couldn't fly an airship that low over urban areas. When tested, some blimps couldnt get close enough because of the heavy winds.

If they were to succeed, they would have become a major aviation accommidation for transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be constructed and put on to the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task. The Empire State Building's frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framework. Once the framework was adjusted, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from the inside. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed. Once the roof was constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own skeleton of steel. Once the entire project was finished, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous. After all the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose.	2	2		2																						231	12	254	7	0	0	4.93073593073593	19.25	63	37	13	9	3	19	128	11.4	10.79	8.01	39	9.6	10.84	12.0	11.2	342

Is because it would have added to much stress to the frame of the Empire State Building, which could have caused the collapse over a period of time. So the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be ""modified and strengthened to accomade this new situation"", as said in the excerpt. After the builders completed framing the Empire State Building up to the eighty-fifth floor, it was now time to do the framing of the rooftop to create an area where the mooring mast would be placed. After the workers completed the framing of the rooftop, they build the mooring mast on to it, now the builders faced the challenge of framing the mooring mass. The builders framed the mooring mast with a skeleton of steel. The builders faced these challenges in the attempt to allow derilibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	2	1		2																						183	7	199	5	0	0	4.628415300546448	26.142857142857142	59	25	3	4	1	15	99	13.4	9.41	7.69	22	9.9	12.41	14.5	10.0	243

9532	15482	6	In the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First there was the obvious concern, safety, a dirigible dangling over New York City does not seem very safe. And it @CAPS1 wasn't a reasonable thing to build, the empire state building was already tall enough, why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway.	1	1		1																						75	3	84	4	0	0	4.906666666666666	25.0	23	11	7	7	1	10	38	14.2	10.68	9.09	18	11.9	15.33	15.833333333333334	13.6	113

""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind Pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". In order to make it work they would use diffrent Steel. Another obstacle the builder @ORGANIZATION1 would be safety. Winds and hydrogen were main focuses.

9542	15492	6	There were a handful of problems that came along with the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building.  This idea was hardly practical, for safety reasons mostly.  If a dirigible docked there on one cable, extreme tension would be put on the building.  Also, if an international dirigible were to dock filled with very flammable hydrogen and catch fire, the results would be catostrophic.The task of actually docking would be a problem as well.  With such a high altitude, winds were very strong.  Nothing could prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building.  In other situations, dirigibles would be weighted down with lead weights.  However, if these were to fall, they would land in the busy city streets of New York.  Lastly, there was a law against low flying air ships, completely dismissing the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																						145	10	174	10	0	0	4.785714285714286	15.4	40	17	11	12	1	18	78	74.8	12.27	14.42	25	58.7	60.76	7.857142857142858	0.0	223

According to paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This problem required over sixty thousand dollares' worth of modifications to the buildings framework. Although structural issues were a problem, the safety of the pidestrians created a even bigger obstacle for the builders.Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium which created huge fire hazzards ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM2).

9556	15506	6	The were many obstacle's the builder's of the Empire State Building had to face in attempt to allow the docking of dirigible's. There was no way architects could drop a mooring mast on top of the building's smooth roof. If a thousand foot dirigible overshadowed the top of the building with only one cable tether, stress the building's frame would be added instantly. Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Another obstacle for the builder's was that the building's steel frame would have to be strengthened to accommodate with this new design. The greatest obstacle in launching this new design was nature. Architects would needed to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be unsturdy. The fact that this design would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street, would worry the architects concern of the population. Architects also had to deal with the law against airships traveling too low above urban areas. This law would state the forbidden right of one to tether a large ship to a bulding, or even approach the area. Although there were attempts of dirigible's to reach a bulding, the entire idea was dropped, much to the architects despite.	3	3		3																						229	12	257	6	0	0	4.890829694323144	19.083333333333332	70	28	13	9	2	19	133	11.1	10.39	8.17	45	8.4	10.61	12.2	11.5	331
9569	15519	6	"During the attemp in building a docking station for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles that made this idea less and less possible. One huge problem was due to the building's foundation. A swinging blimp, which can be up to a thousand feet in length, on top of the building would add a huge amount of stress. This meant extra money would need to be dumped into the strengthening of the foundation and framework, in order to support a huge zeppelin on the mooring mast. Since the building tops out at 1,250 feet in altitude, fierce air currents rip through the top of the building. This caused impossible docking conditions because the blimp could hit the building and pop. Due to the flammability of hydrogen this dangerous eruption could wreck havoc on the densely populated city below. Refering to the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated area.""

Another obstacle was the laws in place that prevented derigibles from flying too low over urban areas. So no dirigibles could have legally docked at the mast anyway. A final obstacle was nature.

Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that it would have been unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable would put people not only inside of the dirigibles, but everyone near and around it, in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there.

9623	15573	6	When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of cilvians. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were many obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful.	3	3		3																						175	9	199	12	0	0	5.005714285714285	19.444444444444443	47	22	14	10	4	21	95	11.9	10.97	7.58	25	9.7	10.5	10.166666666666666	11.2	254

9652	15602	6	Building docks for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was a real challenge for Al Smith. The Steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would put too much stress on the building's frame. The dirigibles were highly flammable and that put a huge risk in safety for the workers in the building and the people on the street. The dirigible's movements could not be monitored due to violent air currents at the top of the building. The main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work was because of the law against airships. The law did not allow airships fly low over urban areas.

The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas.	3	3		3																						104	5	112	0	0	0	5.390476190476191	21.0	26	11	10	10	1	5	61	15.0	11.49	9.33	23	18.2	14.63	12.8	13.8	203

9661	15611	6	The builders that constructed The Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly they could not just simply drop a mooring mast atop the building and hope for the best. The mast would add a large amount of stress to the framework, also factor in the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure, and the framework would need to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a key problem the builders ran into. Most dirigibles were highly flammable, and to have them fly over such a populated city as New York would be impractical. As well as their flammable characteristic there was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So therefore it was illegal to tie up, or even approach the building. The last obstacle the builders ran into was the wind. The winds at that height were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. There was also the fear that the wind would blow the ships into the sharp spires of another building. Including the obstacles and the loss of interest in dirigibles was the result in the discontinuation of the project.	3	4		4																						197	11	212	4	0	0	4.776649746192893	17.90909090909091	51	22	14	18	7	14	111	10.0	9.68	8.05	34	7.9	10.41	11.8	11.0	283

The steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the dirigible to be docked onto it. This modification and strengthening of the building process would call for an investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Next, the safety issue arose after being neglected before the building process began. Most dirigibles there were used outside of the United States contained hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, as opposed to using helium. This was a serious problem for a German dirigible named Hindenburg, when it was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. @ORGANIZATION2 writes ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1).

The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting and no lead weights could be placed on the dirigible to stop it from shifting because it was a serious threat to pedestrians below.

For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground.	2	2		2																						154	5	167	6	0	0	4.577922077922078	30.8	38	23	5	6	4	10	93	15.5	9.35	8.24	23	12.9	14.92	14.25	12.0	213

Most dirigibles were fueled by hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This danger was shown by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, and the owners of the building did not want to face a similar accident in a place as densely populated as New York. Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. This would not only be a technical hassle as it would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible, and make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship as well. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Because of this, docking a ship there would be illegal which obviously way not helpful to the project. In the end, these obstacles were the key reasons that the endeavor failed.	4	4		4																						219	10	236	7	0	0	4.648401826484018	21.9	51	22	18	17	4	17	127	11.4	9.23	8.54	41	10.7	12.96	12.8	13.0	320

""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (¶ @NUM1) They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's fram. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as Lüsted points out in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, as one can see, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigables to dock there."	3	3		3																						222	12	253	9	0	0	4.95045045045045	18.5	69	27	14	9	0	24	124	14.2	10.86	8.56	38	10.6	12.4	19.666666666666668	12.3	316
9769	15719	6	In the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, she describes the difficulties of designing the Mast for Dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. Al Smith the mayor of New York City at the time of construction of the Empire State building came up with the idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York city a technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed desingners discovered problems with mast being installed. They discovered that they would have to modify the steel frame because if a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would transimite stress all the way down the frame to the foundation. due to the load and wind pressure. The wind speeds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible around in the wind, this is very unsafe being close to a building.	2	2		2																						154	7	163	2	0	0	4.558441558441558	22.0	53	16	6	4	1	11	83	12.9	9.0	7.99	24	11.0	12.88	11.8	11.2	213

9781	15731	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles docked there. Based on excerpt, one of these obstacles were the lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. If they got close enough to tie up, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers because of the fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell. Also, for the dirigible to be added, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework.	2	3		3																						177	8	191	6	0	0	4.638418079096045	22.125	49	21	14	10	2	14	98	11.5	9.11	8.57	27	9.5	10.87	10.166666666666666	11.0	246

Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over your ring areas.

Though the idea was good, it provided the builders with many obstacles. For example, when the framework was being built, the mast was going to have to be added to the top. The mast couldn't just be dropped on, however because if a dirigibles were to the moored there, it would put too much stress on the building's framework. This revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger which was very expensive.Another difficulty the builder's faced, after construction was completed, in allowing dirigibles to dock there was nature.

9884	15834	6	Architects of the Empire State Building faced a tremendous amount of obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the man who wanted to construct the tallest building, stated on December 11, 1929, that the Empire State would be 1,250 feet tall. It was decided that the building would have a mooring mast at the top for docking airships like the dirigibles. The blimps, however, was very spacey. Some were as long as one thousand feet in length. So a mooring mast sounds fitting. It would allow dirigibles/blimps to anchor there to refuel as well as letting the passengers off and on.Presently, the purpose of the mooring mast was never carried out. Problems that faced it was that most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the German dirigible Hindenburg incident caused the Empire S Building's owners to realize how bad it would be if it happened above such a densely populated area like New York. The winds on top of the building is always changing. A dirigible tethered to the mooring mast would have the back of the ship swivel around and around. Weights couldn't be added to weigh down the back because the blimp would be right above people walking on the streets. Another practical reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for the blimp to even approach the building.On December 1930, U.S. Navy dirigible reached the mooring mast. However, it could not get close enough to tie the blimp in place due to forceful winds. The captain couldn't even take his hands off the controls in fear. In the late 1930's, the idea disappeared to be replaced by airplanes.	4	3		4																						295	19	332	11	0	0	4.777777777777778	15.631578947368421	84	36	18	23	3	31	161	9.4	9.57	8.46	49	7.3	8.87	7.571428571428571	10.4	420

The Chrysler building was originally only @NUM1 feet and the Empire State building was planned to be @NUM2 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had begun.When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph @NUM3), he wanted something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of @ORGANIZATION3 below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, @NUM4 feet taller then the Chrysler Building.The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that the building seems to face was the elements.

So there were many obstacles when building a docking area for drigibles on the Empire State building.One obstacle was the wind. People cannot control the wind or anything in the wind. So when it was really windy the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth. When the Navy tried to tie up the dirigibles they couldn't get it close to the mooring mast because the winds were strong. That's one obstacle of building docking areas.Another obstacle is safety. The dirigibles used gas instead of helium, so it was very flammable. Also they don't have a lot of control over them. If the dirigible ever came crashing down it would kill a lot of pedestrians.If the Navy could fix these obstacles then the dirigible would be a good idea. They are hard to fix but probably possible. The better idea though is to just get rid of them.	2	3		3																						169	15	194	1	0	0	4.482558139534884	11.466666666666667	40	19	12	13	4	15	111	7.1	7.88	6.11	16	6.4	7.77	7.7142857142857135	10.3	235

In order for the mooring mast to successfully hold a dirigible, over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the framework of the building. Still @CAPS1 got in the way, the greatest being safety. Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen gas rather than helium, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State building realized how bad a dirigible fire would be, and more so if it took place over the densely populated city of New York. Wind also was a serious factor that disassembled the idea. If the dirigible were to be tied to the mast, the back of the ship which swing around, and lead weights were out of the question. Blocks of lead hanging above pedestrians in the streets of New York was neither a practical nor safe idea. An additional obstacle was the existing law that would not allowed airships to fly low, or too close to urban areas. Even if it was attempted, ships would have a hard time docking because of forceful winds. These @CAPS1 were all stumbled across in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, an idea that is no longer considered.	4	4		4																						221	11	242	10	0	0	4.6877828054298645	20.09090909090909	61	26	17	14	6	23	119	10.7	9.23	8.21	40	9.9	12.02	12.8	12.1	326

One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles."	3	3		3																						178	9	196	8	0	0	4.842696629213483	19.77777777777778	40	21	23	13	4	19	97	11.3	10.21	8.97	37	9.8	11.96	8.142857142857142	12.1	261

A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building.

10002	15952	6	In, The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. This means the still frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable.Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.	4	3		4																						187	11	210	7	0	0	4.824468085106383	17.09090909090909	58	20	12	8	3	18	109	10.8	10.15	7.94	33	8.2	10.26	10.5	10.8	264
10005	15955	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. The thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The second problem was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The third problem was the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. It was over sixty thousand dollars worth to make the buildings framework. But unfortunately all the problems were unsolved and the height made it desirable to postpon to a later date but instead of becoming the transportation of the future, they had been given away to airplanes.	3	2		3																						158	7	173	2	0	0	4.905063291139241	22.571428571428573	48	20	10	5	5	12	90	13.0	10.97	8.26	31	10.9	12.58	11.8	11.8	230

The Goodyear blimp called the ""Columbia"" attempted to reach the mooring mast although they had a skillful pilot he could not get the Steel framed balloon close enough to dock on the Spire. Another factor the architects did not weigh in to the equation was that most diridibles were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable. If a zeppelin did catch on Fire then that would be on massive ball of fire coming down on the streets of downtown New York.

10020	15970	6	The builders of the Empire state building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, after Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there.	3	4		4																						167	8	184	9	0	0	4.838323353293413	20.875	40	20	16	11	1	16	89	11.8	10.21	8.64	36	10.3	11.95	11.333333333333334	13.0	257

To combat this, @MONEY1 of modifications had to made to the building's framework. Unfortunately, most of the complications of the mooring mast were not considered until after it was built. A most important one was safety, in that that many foreign dirigibles to use helium to float which is highly flammable. A disaster like the Hindenburg disaster over New York City is too dangerous to risk. Another preventer of the mast were the winds at the top of the building that were constantly changing due to the violent air currents. The swaying dirigible could not be secured with hanging weights due to the danger of dropping one over a very populated New York City. A huge complication of making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a docking to ever take place. The many obstacles that face the builders of the Empire State building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, eventually led to the dropping of the idea all together.	4	4		4																						220	11	238	5	0	0	4.931818181818182	20.0	61	30	16	14	1	17	118	11.8	10.85	8.5	46	9.9	12.18	11.0	13.0	340

Most of the blimps from outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen other than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. And they did not want to risk anyone getting hurt in a densely populated area. Also, another big obstacle was @CAPS1 nature itself. At times the winds would be violent and it would go back and forth. And if a blimp was attached, it would be dangling violently over citizens had not nearly safe. Lastly, it was illegal to have airships flying close to urban areas and New York was highly dense. And the reason for this law is for nothing bad to happen to the citizens. In conclusion, there were many obstacles the builders had gone through, and they were blinded by the project and they wanted to get it done they forgot about safety."	3	4		4																						205	11	229	10	0	0	4.655339805825243	18.727272727272727	48	23	15	14	9	25	123	10.9	9.11	8.04	30	8.9	10.93	15.0	11.2	292

They would need to find a way to dock the dirigibles to the mast with out having it swing in the wind. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM1). Another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building was designing the mast. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM2). The Empire State Building's steel frame had to be strengthened in order to withstand to weight of the mast."	2	2		3																						125	7	144	2	0	0	4.808	17.857142857142858	43	20	3	4	1	12	64	13.7	9.93	7.4	15	10.7	11.92	15.5	12.0	176

The excerpt states ""The steel frame of the empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened"". This shows that in order for the mast to even be built the structure of the entire building would need to be altered to accomidate the use of the mast. The second obstacle they faced, in the actual use of the mast, was nature. In hopes of docking the dirigibles to the mast, mother nature would not allow it, as it @CAPS1 in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" They also warned that with those air currents the passengers would not make it off of th dirigible safely due to the end of the dirigible floating rapidly undocked. They feared that if they docked the end it would be unsafe to the pedestrians below just as the helium in the dirigible would of as well."	3	3		3																						179	8	196	5	0	0	4.5083798882681565	22.375	45	19	12	10	1	15	105	11.0	8.59	8.1	29	9.7	11.87	8.666666666666666	11.2	249
10132	16082	6	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, explains how the spire of the Empire State Building was originally meant to be used as a mooring mast. This purpose of the spire was never to be fulfilled because of the numerous problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the biggest problems that the builders faced were unpredictable and violent winds, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, and air laws. The winds posed to be a problem because even though the front of the dirigible would be tethered to the mast belonged back side would be allowed to swing freely in the wind which could cause it to crash into another moored dirigible. The winds also would make just getting to the Empire a hazardous job. The use of hydrogen was a problem because hydrogen is a volatile gas in the sense that it explodes, which would be very dangerous over a densely populated area. Lastly, the air laws were a problem because the United States has a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make a mooring at the Empire State Building illegal."	4	3		4																						208	7	226	9	0	0	4.6875	29.714285714285715	59	24	13	11	3	17	115	15.5	9.99	8.53	35	12.5	14.0	14.75	12.0	294
10135	16085	6	"Without a doubt, the builders of the mooring mast that was to rest at the top of the Empire State Building were highly innovative and ambitious. However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties that they both overcame and were overcome by. One major difficulty that they faced was that a one thousand foot long dirigible being tethered to a 1,250 foot tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a great deal of stress onto the building, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" @CAPS1, the builders were over to overcome this problem. After the building however, the mooring mast was not able to be used for it's full purpose because of more challenges that it faced. After the tragic accident with the Hindenburg, ""the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a density populated area such as downtown New York."" Another concern was that with such strong winds and only being able to tie the front of the dirigible to the moor, the back would swing around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" The final challenge facing the mooring mast was the prexisting law against low-flying aircraft. This put an end to Al Smith's dreams."	4	4		4																						275	11	309	11	0	0	4.821818181818182	25.0	74	26	25	11	7	26	165	16.6	10.51	8.71	46	12.9	14.71	19.333333333333332	12.3	385
10148	16098	6	The obstacles that the builders faced are flying blimps too low in the area and making the Empire State building taller than its actually supposed to be. Like in @CAPS1 three Al Smith realized that he's in danger of losing his title for world's tallest building. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building would reach a height of 1,250 ft. All he had to do is add a top or a hat to the building and that would make it even taller than any other building in the city. Anothe obstacle they faced was a law about airships flying too low above urban areas. They made this law so no airship would ever tie up with a building. Flying too low is a huge safety hazard; it could take the lives of hundreds of people.	1	2		2																						139	7	151	3	0	0	4.258992805755396	19.857142857142858	38	18	8	7	3	11	78	8.6	6.85	8.03	16	7.5	9.11	11.0	8.0	179
10151	16101	6	"Coming from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State building was to be so much more. The hazards of the gases in some of the Dirigibles was a huge risk because some were flammable. Having the mooring mast in the huge city served potential threats to the safety of the city and population as well. As well is the safety threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds. With the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue the architects had over looked. After all the safety issues and weather problems, there was still the fact that a law forbid the idea. Making the mast idea out of the question. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they would of had to dealt with, the mast was never built, and very unfortunate that after all the planning, there was absolutely no way the dirigibles could ever land there."	2	3		3																						174	9	196	8	0	0	4.563218390804598	19.333333333333332	45	15	12	16	4	20	106	9.7	8.47	7.41	21	8.5	9.33	8.5	10.0	239
10172	16122	6	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was making the mooring mast. this was a problem because it whould add alot of stress to the building, And safety was an issue. I said that the law restricted this Because you can't Put a Blimp over urban areas because if some thing goes wrong alot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task it was very hard to make it to support a Blimp Because there will be to much pressure on the building. lastly safety there were Blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with. If that were to happen in New York alot of innocent lives will be gone.	3	3		3																						143	7	153	2	0	0	4.398601398601398	20.428571428571427	38	20	7	2	2	9	83	13.6	8.43	8.04	17	10.9	13.12	14.0	9.9	185

For instance in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"" This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" This demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"" This justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced"	3	3		3																						172	6	184	3	0	0	4.662790697674419	28.666666666666668	46	21	8	11	1	14	99	22.0	10.17	8.71	20	17.7	19.76	18.666666666666668	13.8	236
10185	16135	6	The obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles. One of them being the Mooring Mast it's self. The building which wasn't strong enough to hold an airship with it's original design. So the building had to be Modified and Strengthened to accommodate this situation. They would add a rocket shaped tower built out shiny glass and chrome-nickel Stainless steel. This tower would illuminate from the inside. Which would bump the building from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors .

10187	16137	6	There was many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One was the weight. The architects could not just place the mooring mast or it would rush the building. So they had to add over sixty thousands of dollars into the framework. Another problem was safty issues. Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles gass. Hydrogen is highly flameable so that catching on fire above New York was dangerous. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so geting pasengers on and off board would be extremly dangerous to them. Also there is a law in New York prohibiting low flying vehecales so the dirigibles could not had dock their in the first place.	3	3		3																						137	10	147	0	0	0	4.7226277372262775	13.7	38	17	10	6	2	13	79	7.7	9.1	7.77	22	6.3	7.82	5.777777777777778	10.4	198
10191	16141	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there. First the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose because the builders didn't notice all the problems it had. One attempt was the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. The builders had a lot of work to do to actually try and fix the problems but there was just to many. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there.	1	1		1																						133	6	143	2	0	0	4.7593984962406015	22.166666666666668	43	20	7	6	3	8	71	12.1	9.81	8.18	22	10.8	11.89	11.8	11.5	193
10197	16147	6	The builders of the empire state building ran into a lot of problems involving the dirigibles.  One problem is that there was no easy way to make such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while making it look good.  The other, most main reason/problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was just a safety issue.  But a big one.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is extremely flammable.  So, if something were to go wrong with docking the dirigible could catch fire and explode & go down in a densely populated area.  There were a lot of safety and structure issues but they were eventually resolved, (like the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible	1	2		2																						134	7	153	4	0	0	4.478571428571429	20.0	34	19	11	9	6	13	73	67.1	10.41	13.56	22	54.0	55.61	10.166666666666666	0.0	198

A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and if this would have happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the accident would have been much worse. Another obstacle they faced, their greatest obstacle, was the power of nature. Air currents were violent, so the winds were constantly shifting and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered to it. One last obstacle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships to fly too low over urban areas, like New York.

The builders when making the mast didn't think deeply about any of these things.The problems the builders would face would appear right after the mast went up. To start the differences in blimps between countries was a factor, because blimps in the @LOCATION2 used helium to keep the dirigible flying but in places outside the states they used hydrogen which is flammable. This is a major issue for a place like New York that is densely populated. Another safety issue that they can't control was nature, the high winds atop the building would move the back of the blimp around and also when landing the window may push the blimp into the mast which would puncture the dome. Both these safety reasons were why blimps are landed on the ground. However even without both of these reasons there was a legal issue, a law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas.

To solve this, Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building. This would allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers off and on.Another obstacle for allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the stress being added to the building's frame because of a one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether. To accommodate the situation, the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened and modified. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The final and greatest obstacle for successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Lead weights would be used to weight down dirigibles landed in open fields. But losing the lead weights at the Empire State building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not very safe at all.	3	3		3																						207	11	229	5	0	0	4.798076923076923	18.90909090909091	70	25	10	8	5	18	111	11.6	10.1	8.32	34	10.2	11.18	15.75	11.8	302

The builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat. Most of the problems presented for the most part were concerning safety. Due to safety issues the mast was considered to lucrative and idea, and posed too much of a danger. There were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. One of these issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flamable gases, that if something went wrong a flamming dirible coming down on down town New York City would cause major damage. Another obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the dirible tethered to the mast would be ""constantly shifting due to the violent air currents (para @NUM1).

So if what happened to the Hindenburg happened at the empire state building then the accident would of been much worse. Especially with people walking the streets below, stated in paragraph @NUM2. Another problem was nature. The winds were ferocious at the top of he building and were always shifting. So if a dirigible was docked to the mask and the lead weights that keep the dirigible from floating away, like anchors, would be dangling over pedestrians ready to fall in an instant, stated in paragraph @NUM3.

10430	16380	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the height of the building. First, due to the alleged, projected height of the mast there were concerns on how to evenly distribute the dirigible's weight. The structure of the dirigible and the fact that it was lighter than air was crucial to understand. Taking this into account, the builders had to figure out how to have the whole building support the dirigible's weight and not just the top mast. Had the dirigible be supported by only the mast itself, the dirigible's weight would probably pulled the mast right out of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. The mast was not made in a business fashion, but more of an extravagant manner, with much of it made out of glass because of many windows. This made the mast's installation a lot more harder because they had to watch the mast be installed from all areas. The builders faced many obstacles in making sure that the Empire State Building was acceptable for dirigible docking.	2	2		2																						192	9	211	6	0	0	4.8125	21.333333333333332	51	22	17	8	3	15	116	11.9	10.04	7.57	29	9.2	11.44	12.2	11.9	276
10437	16387	6	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacles the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the buildings frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it will invole the the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework of the building will cost too much money. The stress of the building will come from the dirigibles's load and wind pressure. Another Obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constinously shift. They didnt wand to use lead weights because it was to dangerous. because they were dangling high over predestrains. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock.	3	3		3																						173	11	188	0	0	0	4.820809248554913	15.727272727272727	50	28	8	8	1	14	97	9.9	9.92	7.69	26	7.7	9.46	7.7142857142857135	10.1	238
10439	16389	6	Builders faced many problems with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. The first problem they faced was the wind at the top of the building. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock at the building, the wind wouldn't allow it to get close enough without moving out of control like hitting another building. This made it impossible for the dirigible to dock and so the Los Angeles gave up. Another reason builders faced a problem with with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, was that there was a law that said airships were not @CAPS2 to fly low over urban areas. This law would prevent any and all dirigibles from coming near the building and therefore they wouldn't be able to dock.	2	2		2																						130	6	140	2	0	0	4.638461538461539	21.666666666666668	34	20	9	4	3	7	72	11.3	9.05	6.9	15	9.4	9.6	11.8	10.5	184

Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers. this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low.

10443	16393	6	The Empire State Building wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on top. To do this the would need to build a mast on top so that the dirigibles could hook on to and refuel. They ran into a lot of problem right off the bat and kept running into them. The first problem, of many, was that they could not just plop a mast on the top because it would be to unstable and cause to much stress to the structure. To prevent that what they ended up doing was modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole costing over sixty thousand dollars. Once they figured out how to equal out all of the wind pressure, they had to think of how to bring the dirigibles in, the answer was simple electrical winches. The next problem was safty, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen and if that blew up it would not be good for the densely populated city below. Another safety issue was nature's violently shifting winds and to solve the problem on the ground they would waive the back down with lead weights to keep it from sweying, but doing that in the air over a lot of people could be unsafe. The final nail in the coffin to this plan was that there is a law for bidding airships to fly too low over urban areas.	3	4		4																						232	9	248	6	0	0	4.293103448275862	25.77777777777778	47	35	15	8	7	16	146	11.7	7.49	7.84	35	9.8	12.04	11.2	10.3	311

With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land. Although the bricks keep the tail from moveing around, having them hang over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not save. In the end the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was disbanded due to many problems that could arise.	3	3		3																						190	10	203	3	0	0	4.705263157894737	19.0	58	23	11	5	5	17	105	10.3	9.63	7.49	25	8.3	10.13	7.571428571428571	10.6	267

10549	16499	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin, the architects were unable to just drop the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This was due to the fact that a dirigible held by a cable would add stress to the building's frame. Though this was an obstacle, the architects spent over @MONEY1 on modifications to the frame to remedy the problem.Another major problem with the idea of the mooring mast was general safety. First off, most foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, as compared to helium, to stay aloft. This problem lay within the fact that hydrogen was highly flammable, and after the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1937, architects became concerned that the same accident could occur over downtown @LOCATION1.In addition, the mast idea proved unsafe due to violent wind currents. To keep from blowing around, dirigibles needed lead weights, which couldn't be allowed to dangle over busy city streets. In conclusion, a final obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban a city. This made it legal for all airships to tie up or ******** this area. Those were the obstacles facing the architects.	4	4		4																						202	11	235	11	0	0	4.975369458128079	18.454545454545453	58	27	19	9	2	25	105	12.3	10.85	8.72	42	9.9	11.42	12.8	12.7	305

This mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station, which, at the time, blimps were very unsafe, and  lacked a suitable landing area so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off. A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, and took over sixty thousand dollars' to do so. After Construction took place, it was then decided if an incident, such as the Hindenburg occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. But the largest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, due to violent air currents, and although tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, the usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe.

Another problem was working with nature. There were violent air currents constantly shifting atop the building, causing the back of ships to swivel around the mooring mast. The dirigibles couldn't simply be weighed down in the back, because that would be a safety hazard. The last problem builders faced was the law. At the time, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities.

He did this by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast at the top of the building, reaching 1,250 feet high. There was obstacles in the way of attaining this goal. Safety was the greatest reason why it was never used as a docking station. Hydrogen was used in the dirigibles, which was highly flammable. An accident had already occurred having to do with a dirigible, called Hindenburg, in New Jersey. As popular as New York is they couldn't take the risk of putting harmful, dangerous gases in a densely populated area. Another problem that occurred to stop this building from being used as a mooring mast was the powerful wind currents that constantly shifted. The dirigible would be dangling high over pedestrians swivelling around because of the wind, this made it very unsafe and not even practical. One last reason the Empire State Building would not be able to have a mooring mast in which dirigibles could land was because there was a law which stated airships were not allowed too low over urban areas.
