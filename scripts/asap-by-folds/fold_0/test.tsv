Spring is the  sign  of  life  and  birth  or  renewal. The geese come back. They are “renewed” in a symbolic sense. When the snow melts you can see the grass again which is a sign of life. When plants bud they are born. The  character  decides  when  nature  is symbolically reborn  and  renewed she  will start again just like nature.	2	3		3																						112	8	146	2	0	0	3.9124087591240877	17.125	35	12	3	6	6	15	63	7.1	7.94	6.87	13	7.6	7.74	5.875	8.1	165

Even though she failed the test the first time she feels that if she studies and trys again she can pass. This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again. Saeng feels a connection with the plants rebirth and feels she can start over again to and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng vowes to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms."	2	2		2																						117	6	125	0	0	0	4.444444444444445	19.5	30	20	2	7	7	9	68	9.2	8.12	7.03	10	6.2	8.83	8.0	8.3	145
6000	9556	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story. Everything that happed to Saeng  while she was at the florizd  is summed upinto  something resembling vengeance. The whole reason that Saeng was sad in the first place was that she failed her driving test. In the final paragraph, she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus that Saeng  bought will begin budding in the spring, when the snows melt. The last paragraph of the story gives roem for Saeng to dealhtith her nostalgiaover the winter season. Finally, the  geese that fly south make Saeng feel sad, but they light a spark within her she tells herself that she will take the driving test again when the geese return, when the hibiscus buds, and when the snows melt.	2	2		2																						143	7	161	6	0	0	4.52027027027027	21.142857142857142	37	22	8	4	2	18	80	10.6	9.11	7.63	13	7.7	9.84	8.666666666666666	10.0	190
6008	9564	4	The author wrote the paragraph because she went back in side the house to get a dinner and because ain’t going to see the garden until the other day and because the winter come and she will not play outside anymore until the winter goes. Like she said “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”.

6016	9572	4	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story	1	1		1																						70	4	74	0	0	0	4.47887323943662	17.75	15	10	4	7	1	6	42	8.7	8.47	7.21	9	6.6	9.86	10.25	10.1	93
6018	9574	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus"", the auther finishes the story with this last paragraph, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again. The auther finishes the story with that paragraph because in the beginning, Saeng had purchased hibiscus plant because it had reminded her of her hometown. (“Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world”) So she purchased it, but since there was bad weather at the time, Saeng had to get the plant back in time and plant it in the graden. But she failed setting if there on time. That is why it says “I will take that test again"". And she will take it again during the spring when the hibiscus blooms once again. That is why the auther finished the story with that paragraph."	2	2		2																						164	8	183	8	0	0	4.5060975609756095	20.5	34	26	4	13	7	21	104	13.5	8.48	6.72	10	10.4	11.9	29.5	10.5	210
6019	9575	4	The author concludes the paragraph like this because it shows that she @MONTH1 not going to give up. I @MONTH1 this because she vowed silently to herself that she was going to take the test again during the spring, also, it was the aiudieres not the gains in old years seeds an ezing. In conclusion they one the reason why the author concludes the paragraph like this.	1	1		1																						67	3	72	2	0	0	4.507462686567164	22.333333333333332	12	10	1	3	0	7	42	11.0	8.54	7.57	6	8.4	9.52	11.5	6.4	87

6028	9584	4	I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM1).	1	2		2																						56	4	65	3	0	0	4.696428571428571	14.0	10	11	2	5	1	9	35	7.7	8.34	7.15	7	6.4	7.74	7.25	9.5	78

6032	9588	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes. Saeng vowed silently to herself. That shows she calm down already, she feels better with her new country. She feels the snows meet, the geese return, she says that she will take that test again. It shows one that she doesn’t feel bad with the test more. She knows that she has opportunity to take it again and does it better. She has a different feeling with her problem. She looks her new country with a different eyes. All things with her become better. These are some reasons explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph.	2	1		2																						110	10	123	3	0	0	4.627272727272727	11.0	20	21	8	6	1	14	65	5.9	7.69	7.2	8	4.0	4.76	4.3	6.3	143
6037	9593	4	I believe that author ended the story with that sentence because it give a lifting feeling after the story was so sad. Saeng missed her homeland, was sad, used the flowers as relief, sad about her driving test and realy liked the plant. So the last sentence seemed to fit in as a confort zone to make the reader a bit more relieved.	1	1		1																						63	3	69	3	0	0	4.285714285714286	21.0	18	10	5	3	1	7	35	9.3	7.02	8.44	10	7.9	8.4	10.5	3.1	82
6039	9595	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends the story with this paragraph because it reveals the importance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the story Saeng moves from Vietnam and feels very homesick. She fails her drivers test and is very upset. When she sees the familiar plant she is reminded of her home in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus reminds Saeng of fond memories with her grandmother and simple things such as her fine. Toothed buffalo-horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water. When seeing the familiar plant. “Saeng felt a shock recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. ”This shows how important the hibiscus was to her. The author ended the story with that paragraph to show how the winter hibiscus is a comfort to Saeng and will encourage her to do better on her next driver’s test.	2	2		2																						145	10	158	1	0	0	4.731034482758621	14.5	41	18	15	5	5	18	74	9.9	9.39	7.47	15	8.0	9.45	7.857142857142858	11.5	206
6044	9600	4	The author concludes the story with a sentence about retaking her test when the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding because they each represent something else. The geese represent change because they change their environment in the winter just like Saeng changes her environment by going to the plant place. The hibiscus reminds her of home because at her home there are similar plants. The hibiscus budding represents a new life just like the one Saeng has to live in a new home. Overall, the sentence that the author era’s with is used to show @CAPS1 life as compared to the geese and hibiscus.	2	2		2																						106	5	112	1	0	0	4.69811320754717	21.2	28	16	5	5	2	9	58	11.3	9.57	7.22	12	9.2	10.74	12.0	11.6	149
6054	9610	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it.	2	2		2																						124	5	137	6	0	0	4.435483870967742	24.8	27	19	8	6	5	18	70	11.9	8.07	7.54	14	9.4	11.21	14.0	9.9	163
6059	9615	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show her determination. When she says. “…when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Saeng is explaining how the geese have the determination to fly back and that the hibiscus has the determination to bud again so why shouldn’t she have the determination and confidence to take the test again. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” It seems as if failing the driving test made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country. But after she saw the geese’s and hibiscus’s determination through harsh conditions, she was determined to try the test again.	2	2		2																						117	7	128	3	0	0	4.627118644067797	16.857142857142858	24	25	5	6	6	16	69	15.2	9.82	7.79	11	12.4	13.77	14.5	13.0	161
6060	9616	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to explain how she already took the test and it is now winter, she will retake the test again when all of the flowers and plants come back to life and start again. Saeng wants to take the test again to show her mother that she can pass it, she bought a plant called. dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars to help her mother not be disapointed. However mother was disapointed that she spent that much money on a plant.	1	1		1																						87	4	95	2	0	0	4.379310344827586	21.75	20	16	2	7	3	10	52	13.7	8.25	7.43	6	11.1	12.06	15.5	8.8	111
6061	9617	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things from her home and living, it will comfort her in what she does. The author seems like she needs things from her homeland that help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of earlier life. I think that whenever I want to do a good job It helps to think of the good  things that mean alot to me so I will be happy and want to do good. The author is smart to want to see those things for her to retake her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again it will be good luck for her.	2	2		2																						129	5	135	1	0	0	3.876923076923077	26.0	23	23	8	4	4	6	80	13.1	5.7	7.07	8	11.2	13.85	13.25	8.8	152
6070	9626	4	I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold.

6073	9629	4	The reason I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph was because it was a good learning story you can learn something from it .The author did that so you can get a better understanding of the of the story. It said “saeng .teenage  girl, and her family have moved to the united states of Vietnam.” So from reading that it tells me that its telling you what happen right before the story took place. So you can get a better understanding. To me its rapping it all up for you. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph.	0	0		0																						105	6	113	1	0	0	4.2924528301886795	17.666666666666668	22	16	3	4	1	11	65	9.4	7.31	6.48	6	7.9	8.78	10.6	7.6	138
6077	9633	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver’s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle.	1	1		1																						52	3	56	1	0	0	4.538461538461538	17.333333333333332	13	9	0	2	0	5	30	8.6	8.29	8.14	8	7.7	10.0	10.666666666666666	11.2	74
6080	9636	4	Saeng is not comftorable in her sorryndings, and has not addapted to the changes from where she moved. She finds the hibiscus and choses to go buy it, because it reminds of her home in @LOCATION2. When she brings it home  her mother seems shocked at first by the price saeng had paid, but is then more sympathetic when she realizes she misses @LOCATION2. Sheang says she is going to retake her test in the spring. She is also implying that she is going to change her attitude about living in @LOCATION1.	2	1		2																						92	5	101	3	0	0	4.43010752688172	18.6	16	18	3	5	3	12	56	8.8	7.95	8.5	12	6.9	11.27	11.2	11.2	124
6081	9637	4	I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back.	0	0		0																						19	1	20	0	0	0	4.157894736842105	19.0	3	5	0	1	0	1	11	7.7	6.56	7.07	3	7.2	7.6	8.5	0.0	25
6083	9639	4	The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that.	1	1		1																						62	3	67	1	0	0	4.080645161290323	20.666666666666668	10	14	0	3	2	6	38	8.1	6.04	6.45	2	5.5	8.28	10.333333333333334	3.1	70
6086	9642	4	The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng.	1	2		2																						94	5	103	4	0	0	4.351063829787234	18.8	21	13	6	7	3	12	55	14.7	7.79	7.04	8	12.0	14.22	17.0	9.7	122
6087	9643	4	The author ends the story with  “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. “ A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her.” She wants to be able to handle the loss better. The author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over.	2	2		2																						132	6	143	4	0	0	3.962406015037594	22.166666666666668	26	23	7	12	6	15	76	10.5	5.64	6.62	9	8.9	11.47	13.25	8.2	161
6090	9646	4	The author ends with this response  because he is trying to say that Saeng will repeat her self but this time more helpful in the garden and her mother.Try harder with her school work and less focusing on gardening.	0	0		0																						39	2	43	0	0	0	4.317073170731708	20.5	10	6	1	3	3	4	23	19.3	9.18	8.41	5	16.1	17.65	21.5	0.0	53

When she says this she is refering to her drivers test she says she will take the test again because she is reminded that her family didnt give up they moved to @LOCATION1 for a fresh start “plant she had forgotten drew her back to her childhood world. “She sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before.

6098	9654	4	When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he don’t want people to think that she just worries about the plants.	1	1		1																						72	5	76	0	0	0	4.152777777777778	14.4	15	15	2	4	2	6	45	7.1	6.2	6.72	3	5.6	7.76	8.25	6.0	84
6105	9661	4	She said this too show the determination it takes to make it no matter how many times you fail you need to get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this way also, it takes alot for someone to fail something and to get back up and try again on it. She isnt willing to accept failure, and she's trying to redeem her failure so she says she'll try again. That is why she ended the story that way.	1	1		1																						82	4	91	2	0	0	3.975609756097561	20.5	9	19	2	12	4	5	58	7.6	5.22	6.96	7	6.6	8.69	10.5	6.0	100
6119	9676	4	He author concludes this paragraph in this story because It sounds good and to show the people he is writing it to that no matter what happend s to you in life you should Just keep on doing what you think is best for you.

6137	9694	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means that when she gets older and gets more confidence then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready just like the hibiscus will be ready to start to budding again.	1	1		1																						71	1	72	0	0	0	4.253521126760563	71.0	10	14	5	5	4	1	45	34.1	8.5	9.16	6	26.3	29.53	38.5	0.0	87

6148	9705	4	The author included this paragraph to show how much the girl missed Vietnam. When the girl saw the hibiscus it brought back memories of Vietnam. Seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort. So the paragraph is there to show how the United States is different from Vietnam. Since the United States has changing seasons it allows the girl to get use to the United States. The plant will always be there, but she has to look for the good that United States provides. The author states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote shows how the girl was getting use to the United States. How she will always remember Vietnam, and finds things in the United States that remind her of Vietnam. In conclusion, the paragraph is used to show how much the girl missed Vietnam, but how she finds comfort within the United States.	1	2		2																						172	10	189	8	0	0	4.680232558139535	17.2	49	28	7	9	3	13	97	10.2	9.28	6.42	15	8.4	9.5	7.142857142857142	9.4	235
6156	9713	4	"The author concluded this because she thinks this is the right time to re take the test. She adds this because the snow is melted, the hibiscus is budding, and the geese return is a perfect time because everything is back and warm. She says ""when they come back...then I will take the test again.” means she will have all confidence to take the test. Saeng voweds to take it again and she will and she thinks this time she will pass.

6160	9717	4	In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story “Winter Hibiscus”. In the story the young girl finishes of by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself” but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last “vowe” is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girls determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says “and this hibiscus is budding” its showing the girls connection with the plant because of the comfort and canfidence it given her, ecpecially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl was with her the flower and the homeland.	2	2		2																						161	6	169	3	0	0	4.708074534161491	26.833333333333332	39	21	11	7	6	17	92	14.2	9.99	8.5	28	12.6	14.7	12.4	14.1	239
6169	9726	4	The author ends the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the passage “When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time. I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her home land so she thought when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. The plant made her think positivly. And insted of thinking she will fail she is thinking she will pass the next time. I also think Saeng felt comforting her when she was upset and I think that helped her feel alot better.	2	2		2																						138	6	145	2	0	0	4.260869565217392	23.0	23	31	6	9	5	11	81	12.4	7.38	6.95	10	9.3	12.49	18.333333333333332	10.4	172
6173	9730	4	The author conconcludes the story with this paragraph because, the plant brings back memories to Saeng and she is sort of like the plant. Saeng can be compared to the plant by, she is starting out in a new area that she is unfamiliar with, as well as the plant. The plant is now being planted in the soil outside of her house and has to grow. Saeng has to learn to grow aswell and get better and prepare to take the test again. So when the plant is grown and adapted Saeng believes she will be grown and adapted too. In conclusion, this paragraph is a perfect ending for the story “Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho.	2	2		2																						117	6	127	4	0	0	4.239316239316239	19.5	25	18	5	10	6	13	69	8.3	6.79	7.03	13	7.4	9.51	10.6	8.3	148

6181	9738	4	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has new. found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her."	2	2		2																						200	12	232	9	0	0	4.54	16.666666666666668	51	30	11	11	6	29	110	11.1	8.12	7.66	18	8.4	10.28	11.2	9.7	252

6187	9744	4	In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose the to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. Saeng’s situation is similar to the flower’s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home	3	3		3																						158	7	176	14	0	0	4.7215189873417724	22.571428571428573	36	25	11	3	8	24	83	14.0	9.81	8.96	28	11.1	13.79	15.75	12.7	223
6202	9759	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver’s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph.	2	2		2																						55	3	58	0	0	0	4.163636363636364	18.333333333333332	11	10	2	1	0	4	33	7.3	6.56	6.27	3	6.9	8.77	8.833333333333334	7.8	69
6210	9767	4	Emotions,symbolizim, to it realized – all are reasons the author concluded the story that way. a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you, with mixed emotions. Emotions like sadness, hope, and wounder. The author makes the reader feel sad with the girl failing her test and missing home. The author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered. the author uses symbolizes in the concluding, sentances by giving the plant and the geese a sense of impotance in the story and the plant has to do with the home that she really misses. In the final story the author leaves a lot of peceptions on several. Like the importance of the plant and why did they move from a place that they lavd so much. That is why I think the author ended the story that way.	2	1		2																						158	10	175	6	0	0	4.405063291139241	15.8	47	23	5	5	6	18	85	10.6	7.96	7.46	21	9.7	11.32	14.25	10.3	216
6215	9772	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.	1	1		1																						53	1	56	1	0	0	4.3584905660377355	53.0	7	11	1	2	1	3	35	25.6	8.66	8.35	4	20.4	21.2	26.5	0.0	67
6220	9777	4	Several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life. Also when the hibiscus starts budding she will feel conforted, as though it auomaticaly brings back her childhood memories. It also is a link to her past home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again. Its as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, she will also be ready.	2	2		2																						85	5	96	6	0	0	4.270588235294118	17.0	17	12	8	5	1	12	52	7.2	6.44	6.71	9	6.4	8.68	8.7	9.4	109
6227	9784	4	I think the author concludes like this because its almost like a new beginning. The ending of the story makes you think that Saeng is going to get on with her life. It makes me think that @CAPS1 plans to start her life over in comparison with the hibiscus. Once the plant “starts over” (rebuds) she will start over once again. It also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in @LOCATION1. She will not let her life be distraught by her move Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to start her life over again. The ending is a “cliff hanger” to show that her story has not yet completely ended. It shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life. It also shows she doesn’t let her failures control her. She is a strong young woman and is determined to overcome this.	2	2		2																						154	11	167	0	0	0	4.266233766233766	14.0	27	27	7	10	1	17	95	5.7	6.31	6.89	17	5.2	7.42	7.0	8.3	198
6234	9791	4	The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. It show a small amount of newfound confidence Saeng now has. This ending also shows how much of an effect the “Winter hibiscus” had on her. with bringing back memories of her old country. If Saeng wouldn’t have found the hibiscus, she would have never started to reminisce about her old home. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her past, but it also helped her compare her new home to her old home. Through this she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so bad, and that she still has a little bit of her old home with her everyday. This realization gave her just enough hope and confidence to want to try the driving test again This ending shows the change of heart Saeng feels for @LOCATION1 and her small gain of hope and confidence.	3	2		3																						162	8	174	4	0	0	4.432098765432099	20.25	40	23	14	9	5	16	93	11.0	8.25	7.12	16	8.8	11.71	11.8	11.8	216
6237	9794	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again”. She is saying that she wants to start over. and adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again. because she says “when the snow melts and the geese return.” She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way.	2	1		2																						128	8	138	4	0	0	4.1171875	16.0	22	27	5	4	2	15	75	10.8	6.33	6.88	8	8.6	10.87	13.0	7.6	155
6238	9795	4	I think the author concludes the story like that because its showing the time that will be passing. When it shows time passing, she’s grew up more and maybe she’ll be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is. Also because the hibiscus will be budding, that will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed because it all make her feel more like secure home feeling. “hibiscus is budding” this way the flower will be starting new and so will she.	2	1		2																						85	4	91	2	0	0	4.376470588235295	21.25	14	15	6	6	3	10	51	13.4	8.01	7.64	10	10.8	12.26	14.833333333333334	7.8	107
6243	9800	4	In the story “winter @CAPS1” the author concludes the story with the last paragraph like that because when the season comes back around for budding she is going to be right back out there exsploring. She’s going to want to learn more about the hibiscus and what they do. And she can’t wait to start taking care of them as they start to bud. Thats why they ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																						73	5	78	0	0	0	4.383561643835616	14.6	9	16	3	7	2	8	44	8.3	7.78	6.92	7	6.9	8.42	8.625	7.2	93

I think that  the  hibiscus is an can of  hope and inspiration to her . I  think  that she finally realizes  that  she  is in  @LOCATION1 to stay  and  she  can  go  back to  vietnam .

When  the snows  melt and the geese  return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because  it show that even though the main character Saeng, @MONTH1 a failed once, she will trying again too.

6267	9824	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new life style. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change.	2	2		2																						97	4	108	7	0	0	4.639175257731959	24.25	22	15	7	2	4	12	57	12.5	9.29	8.1	14	9.2	11.78	13.375	9.5	129
6271	9828	4	The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory’s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject.	1	2		2																						148	6	158	4	0	0	4.277027027027027	24.666666666666668	36	21	6	5	3	13	88	11.1	7.43	7.42	13	9.4	10.96	13.75	8.3	188
6276	9833	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng . After failing the drivers test, saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort  to  help  her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence  she decides to plant it. “The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. “Then she sees geese flying in the sky which  is kind of a symbol do that day, something to rembember  it by, so the next year.” When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” She will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger.	3	2		3																						185	10	203	5	0	0	4.178010471204188	19.1	38	30	9	13	7	21	109	14.2	7.79	7.73	20	11.7	13.58	13.75	10.5	234

Basically she did as the geese by lifting her head watching as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance. This is why I believe the author but this to conclde the story...because she was comparing herself ib the geese and does as they did	1	2		2																						121	4	135	3	0	0	4.595041322314049	30.25	26	18	5	10	4	10	76	20.4	9.71	8.64	16	16.6	19.1	19.666666666666668	14.1	172

6284	9841	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph to give you a sense of hope and determination for the future that dwells within saeng at that time .Throught  the story is seemed as though saeng was giving into despair at the remembrance of her home land ,she wasnt doing so well in her new country and and she had realized it the  most when she had “failed her driving test “.but when she  walked past the flower shop and saw all the plants that used to bloom so freely and beautifly  in her home  land comfind  in those ting pots and fighting to survive it reminded her of  herself here in @LOCATION1.

6288	9845	4	I am going to tell you why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason the author does is because it tells you that Saeng is confident. It also tells you she wont give up. And it shows that she is willing to take her ability to the next level. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																						63	5	69	0	0	0	4.174603174603175	12.6	11	10	3	1	1	5	42	4.5	5.61	6.27	4	4.7	6.31	5.7	6.7	82

6315	9872	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One being the fact that she wants to snow sympathay for the hibiscus. Another reason would be showing that Saeng wants to make her mother very proud of her. Meaning that she doesn’t want her mom to think that she is going to give up. This also contributes to the reason that Saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test. Lastly I think that this last paragraph snowed how Saeng wants people to know that even some as small and meaning less as a plant can help her overcome obsticles, and lead her to her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to end the story because of the main fact that how we know that Saeng will not stop believing in herself.	2	2		2																						141	7	149	1	0	0	4.375886524822695	20.142857142857142	25	30	6	5	3	11	83	9.3	7.78	7.1	13	7.6	9.46	8.0	8.4	181
6320	9877	4	I belive the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed that it doesn’t mean her lifes over.

6327	9884	4	The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the “metaphor” compares Saeng and her test to the perenial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathalon, and my goal was to place first, I place @NUM1 overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathalon came again, and I placed @NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.	1	2		2																						122	3	143	16	0	0	4.647540983606557	40.666666666666664	26	21	6	9	6	24	70	20.8	9.53	8.76	12	15.6	17.26	18.333333333333332	11.9	158
6330	9887	4	The author include these paragraph in the story because the it spring, when the snows melt and the geese return. I think the author is talk about winter when it snows and keep snowing until spring hit and then the snow start to melt a way because the sun came out.

6347	9904	4	"In the last paragraphy the reason why the author uses ""when they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test. The author uses this because Saeng finally had found comfort. after  moving from a her homeland veelnam to the united States, she felt home sick. For example, she comes across this flower that reminds her of the time she spent in her homeland. She remember he grandmother's smell because of the plant. So when she finally got home to her mother, she showed the flower to her. They both planted the flower, and @CAPS1 got a sense of relief. Thats why she vowed that when winter was oven and spring came she would take that test, because she had a sense of home in her, that gave her uncouragement and strength. it also shows that even when your are in a different area and you are chew, there's always something that can male you remember the unemove and lime spent where you can from"	2	2		2																						179	9	201	9	0	0	4.377777777777778	20.0	38	27	7	9	7	25	111	12.1	7.84	6.94	14	9.7	11.36	11.4	10.0	231
6351	9908	4	The author concludes the story w/this paragraph because she really isnt worried about when they take the test again, she’s only concerned w/the plants she picked out. Also, she knows that it will be a really long time before she takes the test again so that gives her more time to study and get more prepared and focused. The author also ends this article w/this paragraph because she wants to let the readers know that since she failed the @NUM1 time she will be back again to take it over and nothing will stop the author from failing.	1	1		1																						98	3	110	2	0	0	4.489795918367347	32.666666666666664	17	17	6	10	3	9	64	16.1	8.83	8.64	10	12.5	13.49	17.333333333333332	8.8	125
6354	9911	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the story with the lines “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason that the author concludes the test with these lines is because she is re-establing the symbolism of the plant. In the text it said that the plant budds in the spring, once it has time to grow and adapt to the new enviroment. Just as the plant needed that time so did the main character Saeng. She just moved from Vietnam and failed her drivers test. Saeng is very unsure of her new culture. For example she likes bitter melon it says. “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself much prefered it to a Big Mac.” She appears to think she is misunderstood an no one likes her, but just as the plant will adapt to this new life so will she.	3	3		3																						174	9	190	7	0	0	4.275862068965517	19.333333333333332	39	29	8	11	6	22	101	13.2	7.56	8.25	21	9.9	13.21	18.0	9.7	217
6361	9918	4	The author concludes the story saying that because she wants to show us that Saeng is confident in herself and will not hesitate to take the test again.

The reason why the author had put that at the end of the story was because when things go under ground everyone wants to wait and wait until it comes back up again because when you fail everything goes down but if you wait awhile than everything will start to raise Just like flowers and everything else that you can think of. So that is why the author put that at the end of the story cause to tell people that it is ok for people to fail Just as long as you get up and try again until you reach your goal. So that is what the author was talking about and thats why Minfong Ho put that at the end of the story so that people can read and learn for what it says."	1	2		2																						182	4	195	4	0	0	4.0989010989010985	45.5	32	31	2	14	8	13	120	20.6	6.98	7.45	8	16.3	18.42	27.5	10.1	222
6375	9932	4	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up.	1	2		2																						128	8	139	1	0	0	4.6328125	16.0	27	26	6	7	5	9	79	8.4	8.76	6.9	14	7.2	7.03	6.857142857142857	7.6	173
6379	9936	4	The reason I think author concludes this story with this last paragraph is because this is @CAPS1 passion. And that Saeng is very and will do this every year. She really love plants and she will wait to do it again. The last paragraph really showed a lot of dedication. And she really values the spring and the Hibiscus.	0	0		0																						59	5	64	0	0	0	4.440677966101695	11.8	14	8	2	5	5	7	39	5.4	7.0	6.9	7	5.5	6.08	5.9	8.8	81
6382	9939	4	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn’t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task	1	2		2																						112	4	115	0	0	0	4.241071428571429	28.0	24	15	5	1	1	6	73	12.5	7.43	7.7	13	10.7	12.63	13.75	10.1	145
6385	9942	4	The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the hibiscus flower will be adaptating to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has began to grow older and much wiser of things allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now of where she is living just how the hibiscus flower adapts to it's place with ease and gets use to seasons.	2	3		3																						172	5	187	10	0	0	4.593023255813954	34.4	44	23	9	13	6	19	97	21.7	9.65	8.34	18	17.7	19.06	19.333333333333332	14.2	236
6393	9950	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has something to work for.The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could want to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are the reasons why I think the author put that conclude with the paragraph	1	1		1																						75	3	78	0	0	0	4.381578947368421	25.333333333333332	13	14	2	6	2	3	51	18.2	8.89	6.76	4	14.4	15.0	18.75	0.0	94
6397	9954	4	The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time that Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, were the winter Hibiscus are popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this maner because it remins Saeng about Vietnam, and how she feels better during that time of year. When she says “And beside it was yet another old friend.” She feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable. This is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did.	1	2		2																						102	6	109	2	0	0	4.323529411764706	17.0	23	12	5	6	4	10	60	9.1	7.37	7.43	9	7.7	9.73	11.2	9.4	131
6403	9960	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.	1	1		1																						100	4	104	0	0	0	4.18	25.0	20	16	4	5	8	3	64	10.8	7.03	6.46	6	8.3	10.4	13.0	7.2	121
6407	9964	4	The last line is included in the story “Winter Hibiscus” because it showed the connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time she decides to take it again in the spring. The hibiscus flower like Saeng is out of place and will have to make it through the winter into the spring so it can bud again. This shows how like the flower Saeng will bud again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions in @LOCATION1. So they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to. This shows again how the last line connects the girl and the flower together. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to wrap up the story with a connection between the flower and Saeng.	2	3		3																						150	8	159	1	0	0	4.333333333333333	18.75	37	21	5	7	5	12	96	8.3	7.49	6.25	10	7.1	9.39	11.6	9.8	193
6411	9968	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it expresses the meaning of the story. Life continues no matter what, the hibiscus will return again in the spring. The hibiscus is like a symbol to Saeng's life. The plant normally doesn't survive in winter months, but this one did. The mother says, ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are just like the plant. They are strong and their lives will continue even though they are in a  new environment The author chose to end the story with that parragraph because even  though she say the hibiscus will come back every spring the deeper meaning is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will continue to live their lives."	2	2		2																						135	7	158	7	0	0	4.671532846715328	19.571428571428573	35	15	5	11	5	19	84	10.5	9.17	6.7	14	8.5	9.79	7.142857142857142	10.3	186
6413	9970	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story.

6426	9983	4	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character.	2	2		2																						184	10	205	10	0	0	4.486486486486487	18.5	45	23	12	14	7	26	103	10.1	8.18	7.33	18	7.6	9.4	8.0	8.8	237

6459	10016	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. Durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it it’s winter and the hibiscus hasen’t bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And thats why I think the author ended with that paragraph.	2	2		2																						123	9	132	0	0	0	4.211382113821138	13.666666666666666	24	21	2	10	4	10	77	6.1	6.2	7.35	14	5.8	7.14	6.857142857142857	8.1	158

6506	10063	4	In ‘Winter Hibiscus’, the author concludes with Saeng saying ‘I will take that test, again, it means that Saeng will be ready as soon as the spring arrives and her hibiscus is all in bloom. When Saeng bought the hibiscus, she was sure that as soon as the winter passes with the coming of spring, she is sure that taking the drivers test, again will be easier to overcome the fear and grieving times in a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. Saeng is also sure that the memories of her homeland will help her, too. In the end, its revealed that Saeng has become strong and has high hopes to see her success be fulfilled in her new homeland.	2	1		2																						144	6	158	8	0	0	4.194444444444445	24.0	33	20	13	8	3	14	79	10.3	6.8	6.69	14	7.9	10.43	13.5	8.3	175
6508	10065	4	I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” @CAPS1 it’s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again.	2	2		2																						107	3	114	3	0	0	4.472222222222222	36.0	25	19	6	8	1	16	62	17.6	9.06	8.21	12	13.7	15.78	18.0	9.7	137

Ho, includes this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States, her and her mother had moved here from Vietnam. Throughout the story she is reminising about her home life in Vietnam. About her grandmother, and the flowers there. “Where was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?” When at the flower shop, Saeng finds an hibiscus, flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, wants to become adapted to the @LOCATION3 and beable to live here without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph.

6535	10092	4	“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter.	3	3		3																						205	9	224	11	0	0	4.765853658536585	22.77777777777778	49	38	8	13	7	28	110	13.9	9.99	8.68	32	10.9	12.78	11.8	11.9	291

She missed being home so much because nothing was the same. “It’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. ‘I mean, not like the kind we had at-at'. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. “But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, she decided that she was going to give the drive’s test one more try. “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""	2	2		2																						136	7	151	5	0	0	4.286764705882353	19.428571428571427	26	22	7	10	3	18	83	21.4	7.85	8.21	11	17.4	19.88	19.0	12.5	171
6550	10107	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph before they were talking about the “winter hibiscus” and the geese.

6563	10120	4	THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE REASON BEING THAT THE AUTHOR WANTED TO REALLY SHOW THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER. ANOTHER REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME. FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THAT PARAGRAPH IT SAYS “THEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.”, ITS RELATING THAT SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER.

6568	10125	4	Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding.

6571	10128	4	The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginnig of the story the girl failed the test. And so when she told her mother she saw that she was upset with it. So after they planted the plant she decided to take the test over knowing that her mother would think the best of it. Also its in there because the story started out with her telling her mother that she failed the test.  And if you kept it out people who read it would be like, ok, so her mother just let her fail the test and didn’t do anything about it. Plus when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they are going to be wanting to know if she took it again, and why she took it again if she did.	1	1		1																						137	6	148	4	0	0	3.9420289855072466	23.0	20	25	3	9	5	9	90	10.9	5.58	6.72	8	9.3	11.54	10.4	6.7	165
6576	10133	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he’s saying that once winter and spring’s over and the hibiscus is budding, then I’ll start over again and try again.

The author put this paragraph I think because that the geese return and the flowers is growth she will take the test again bease that when she buy is no flowers came out yet so when it came out she will go again just to let her know that you see the first time and waite when it growth than you can take the test again In my onpion that is a good ending and also it a good question too.	1	2		2																						204	5	208	0	0	0	3.906862745098039	40.8	40	32	8	14	8	10	129	30.9	6.52	8.63	13	25.0	27.67	26.5	9.7	244
6582	10139	4	The author concludes the story with “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She does this to show now Saeng is adapting and making decisions in her new country just like she did in her homeland. In Vietnam Saeng used to brush her grandmothers hair and help put it into a bun and put a hibiscus in it. That was one of her traditions with it. Also when she used to get water from the well a hibiscus would sometimes come up with the bucket. Both these thus the hibiscus was seen as a comfort object, now as she is in the states, she is trying to put it to good use, while also taking into account what repeats in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and plants start to grow in the spring. By her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom. The plant being potted in her garden and Saeng moving her both signify change, but a rembrance of old traditions, and a space for new.	3	3		3																						214	9	231	8	0	0	4.116822429906542	23.77777777777778	46	34	6	13	10	19	136	9.9	6.45	6.37	17	9.0	10.64	11.2	9.4	269
6592	10150	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she want the reader to see that saeng will not stop until she passes her drivers test, just like the geese won’t stop until they are in the south for winter. the author is trying to show the beauty of trying again and going through your obstcles to your goal.	1	2		2																						59	2	62	1	0	0	4.406779661016949	29.5	14	10	1	2	1	6	35	28.8	8.9	8.7	6	22.8	24.28	30.5	0.0	77

Also he was letting us know that spring is here and that is not winter nomore. Thats why she start to plant plants in the winter. So in the spring that can grow out to be nice and beautiful for the spring. Thats what i think the author meant. Also thats the reason why he put that in the paragraph. He should of add more to the paragraph like how the plants and stuff was growing so beautiful. He shouldn't add more details to let us know, what was talking about in this paragraph.	0	0		0																						126	9	141	2	0	0	4.174603174603175	14.0	20	23	6	7	5	9	82	5.2	5.79	5.58	6	4.0	5.6	5.5	6.4	152
6629	10188	4	The authar concludes the story with the paragraph they because it shows saeng determination and her overcoming her obstacles of being new in a country. With all of the doubts saeng had right after her test it is very big of her to come to this conclusion of retaking the test, “Here, let me help you mother,she offered” (HO).

Then when she returns home she tells her mother that she failed the test you can tell from her actions that she is disappointed, “I-I failed the test  Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye  nervously tore off a leab,shredding it to bits”. After a while she planted the flower in the vegetable garden. The buying and planting of the vegetable shows that Saeng wants to remember her grandmother and home.

Memories of her grandmother make her sad but in away make her happy."	3	2		3																						227	8	250	8	0	0	4.3478260869565215	28.75	58	36	10	9	8	22	127	13.4	8.01	7.41	21	10.8	12.24	28.0	11.2	302
6633	10192	4	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng was a very determined person. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng was a strong character because throughout the story she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time. But when she failed, the author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up hope and that she was going to take the test again.	1	1		1																						79	3	83	1	0	0	4.506329113924051	26.333333333333332	17	14	4	5	2	5	50	13.0	8.88	6.94	7	10.0	11.53	14.166666666666666	8.8	104
6642	10201	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show thatshe will do this once she  has gotten use to the change of her new country. When she says, “When the geese return” their faint honks and flying overhead are familiar to her now season upon season. Also when the hibiscus is budding because this will remind her of her home in Vietnam seeing flower and hearing these geese will give her the confidence and encouragement to retake the drivers test.	2	2		2																						120	4	130	6	0	0	4.545454545454546	30.25	29	18	5	5	6	14	68	20.1	9.35	8.12	14	15.4	17.33	17.666666666666668	10.5	159

6644	10203	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus “decided to end the story with this paragraph because its like a new beginning for saeng. In saeng moves and fails the test .The winter hibiscus comforts her from the memories of where she used to live. It gives her hope and in the winter it wouldn’t be as nice as it would be in the spring. Spring is also time for new beginnings because in the winter everything dies and comes back to life in spring .saeng feels she would take the test as a new beginning. From my personal experience I always do spring cleaning because I want to begin fresh. Spring is also filled with fresh air and gives me inspiration to do good. This could be why saeng wants to take the test in the spring time. Therefore the author of “Winter Hibiscus “decided to end the story with that paragraph because they wanted to show how saeng wanted a new beginning.	3	2		3																						161	8	169	0	0	0	4.385093167701863	20.125	41	23	11	6	4	13	89	9.3	7.78	6.79	12	7.6	9.78	12.0	10.7	216
6658	10217	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to explain to us that this plant is going to bring good luck. The snow will melt, the geese will return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. Its starting over fresh, a new beggining. Since she had failed her driving test she will start over in the spring. In conclusion this is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																						76	5	83	2	0	0	4.526315789473684	15.2	16	15	3	0	1	7	42	7.5	7.82	6.47	9	5.7	7.66	7.199999999999999	7.6	98
6659	10218	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to say in the spring when the plant starts over Saeng will start over to. The story shows that this is the meaning because Saeng was having a really hard winter and was having a hard time adjusting to all of the new things, but in the spring she can start over just like the hibiscus will.	1	1		1																						69	2	72	1	0	0	4.217391304347826	34.5	15	9	3	4	2	4	42	15.7	7.5	7.41	5	12.0	14.96	18.75	0.0	86
6663	10222	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show us that her days with nature is not yet over, for when it comes back around, she will continue to do what she been was doing, whicvh was growing her plants, taking care of them, tuning them out to being a goodnight dinner, and to continue that until she’s no longer to do anymore.	0	0		0																						64	1	71	6	0	0	4.3125	64.0	10	12	0	8	1	9	44	30.9	7.97	10.51	9	24.7	26.85	35.0	0.0	83

6678	10237	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons, Saeng was dissapointed for failing her driving test. She found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus his not started to bud, she should not take the drivers test. She feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus. This implies nature comforts her. The author ended it like this because it shows Saeng is not disappointed about failing is anymore. She knows she will have another chance next year when the geese returns and the hibiscus starts to bud. With the comfort of nature, she feels she can pass the test next year.	2	2		2																						123	8	134	3	0	0	4.626016260162602	15.375	28	23	6	1	4	11	67	8.1	8.46	7.35	18	5.8	7.46	7.0	8.5	165
6680	10239	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows her determination. Saeng is having problems with both adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life. we see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” we see that Saeng bought the flower because it made her feel securit. It was something from home that felt familiar to her and I believe thats why she included the story with this paragraph because next year she will have a sense of security and familiarity when taking the test because the experience she had will be making again.	2	2		2																						132	5	140	3	0	0	4.515151515151516	26.4	29	24	5	4	3	13	78	21.9	9.42	8.69	15	18.1	20.63	18.666666666666668	13.6	181
6681	10240	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up. She also concludes with this to tell people that they should never give up and that the should keep on trying. Even if they have to take a break to study or rethinks the plan.	1	1		1																						51	3	54	0	0	0	4.117647058823529	17.0	6	13	0	3	2	4	38	6.5	5.97	6.03	4	5.2	6.8	7.5	3.1	61

6688	10247	4	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed. Since she has failed the test the first time she wants to overcome her failure and succede in it so the author wants her to look determined in the end.	1	1		1																						93	2	100	5	0	0	4.354838709677419	46.5	17	16	4	4	3	9	57	22.3	8.43	8.83	12	17.9	20.32	25.75	0.0	117

6698	10257	4	When the author concluded the narrative by when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles, finding comfort in a time of disappointment, and her connection to her past experiences. First, it demostrates the ability to overcome obstacles because they are obstacles in everyone lives, and you don’t have a choice to conquer them because there are unlimited. So the hibiscus flower represents the obsticles and the weather represent time because weather is stopping the flower to bloom and bloosom. Secondly, it also represent the finding of comfot in a time of disappointment because when you have going through an obstacle you would find disappointment there lingering. However she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back and she have the awareness of the obstacles coming back. Finally, it asserts her connection to her past experience because she is trapped in a world that she is not familiar with, which would make her an alien. She capture the sense of being out of place, because you can relate that the hiatcus flower would be her because she is eccentric and different from the rest of the people in her environment she is trying to adapt her way of living and trying to survive in the world, like when she was in her own country.	2	2		2																						242	7	262	13	0	0	4.818181818181818	34.57142857142857	50	38	8	13	9	26	148	18.6	10.8	8.22	35	15.6	17.15	22.333333333333332	15.7	360
6704	10263	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she saying when everything gets back to normal that’s when she is going to take the test again. Second, because there would be nothing else to say if it is not back to the way she wanted it to be. For instance, if you were building an house and a blizzared came, you would stop, you said that you would not continue until there was nice weather again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.	1	1		1																						95	5	105	5	0	0	4.473684210526316	19.0	16	14	5	5	1	10	65	9.1	8.07	6.57	10	7.2	8.44	10.1	7.6	124

Saeng decided to tell her mother what she had done, “she failed the test” probably her mom get upset with her but then she talk to her again. Saeng  mather’s ask her about the plant that she have with her. Saeng said that she buy the plant by @MONEY1. She was sad because she failed the test and when she buy the plant it probalbly makes her feel better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it bring some kind of hope to her, and she probably will pass the test. When she said “then I will take that test again” @CAPS1 makes her to decide to take it agan it could be the plant.	2	1		2																						130	9	140	2	0	0	4.145038167938932	14.555555555555555	24	25	2	9	4	19	76	7.5	6.38	6.5	9	5.8	8.06	7.833333333333334	7.4	156

6746	10305	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driver’s test. To Saeng her failing the driver’s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng’s promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didn’t give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.	3	2		3																						198	9	213	6	0	0	4.666666666666667	22.0	47	35	7	11	5	23	111	11.6	9.34	7.36	21	9.5	10.62	11.8	10.5	269

6787	10346	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I believe she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, someday being symbolized by when the geese come back. Saeng is sad because she missis her homeland and she sees plants that bringback memories, so she buys a winter hibiscus to ease & comfort her & remind her of home.	1	1		1																						71	2	77	4	0	0	4.436619718309859	35.5	16	14	2	6	3	11	36	17.3	9.12	8.78	9	14.4	15.54	19.75	0.0	95
6793	10352	4	The author comes back to that paragraph because in the story Saeng is so sorry she did not @CAPS1 the test. Now saeng wants to make up for it, She vowed to herself she will @CAPS1 that test. For example, when I say to herself I am going to get sumthin done I do what it takes to get it done and I don't give up when things get rough, @CAPS3, This last sentense is what the main idea of the story is, To make up that test and @CAPS1 it, To get done what needs to be done	1	1		1																						99	4	108	6	0	0	3.7474747474747474	24.75	15	19	4	6	2	10	73	12.7	4.31	7.51	5	11.4	13.6	16.833333333333332	6.4	115
6796	10355	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he is telling the reader that after the snow leaves the author will begin to plant more plants.

6801	10360	4	The reason why is so you get the feeling that Saeng feels about gardening. She is praying for spring to come so she can do it over again. She like to watch plants grow and become something that you can eat. That is way the Author concluded the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																						52	4	56	0	0	0	4.211538461538462	13.0	9	12	0	2	1	5	34	4.9	5.79	6.71	5	3.6	6.74	6.0	7.2	64
6804	10363	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she can go through these obstacles even though she moved from her home land. Also it shows that she has more confidence thats why the author concluded her story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																						44	2	47	0	0	0	4.795454545454546	22.0	10	8	1	2	0	2	29	12.2	10.27	7.6	5	8.3	11.53	12.5	0.0	59

The reason why the author said that Is because she Is trying to tell the readers to get right back up and do it again, If you fell once there Is no harm and trying again. When its spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promise to take the drive's test. After failing a driver test Saeng buys a flower at a florIst that remInded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and put it in the garden. Told her mother that she fail, Saeng's mother was very understand and told her maybe next time In conclusion the author ‘write the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life."	1	2		2																						166	7	186	7	0	0	4.234939759036145	23.714285714285715	37	30	3	15	8	19	103	12.3	6.85	7.2	12	10.6	12.04	13.0	8.8	208
6819	10378	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again maybe you will do alot better.	1	1		1																						103	5	110	2	0	0	4.776699029126213	20.6	20	14	4	8	0	7	64	11.4	10.04	6.04	8	10.1	9.79	12.0	11.2	151

6840	10399	4	The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes.	2	1		2																						93	8	103	2	0	0	4.537634408602151	11.625	23	20	4	3	4	12	52	5.8	7.23	7.27	13	5.5	5.5	5.4375	7.6	128

Basically, the hibiscus(a plant) meant much to the narrator and her mother which was dying and they dug up a hole to help it to grow, so when it grows again that proves that it will be living better. So when Saeng relates the test that will be her her having the opportunity to past the test. The story with this paragraph symbolizing a new beginning about to take place.

6936	10496	4	The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it.	1	1		1																						86	3	91	1	0	0	4.058139534883721	28.666666666666668	16	11	3	4	4	4	58	12.0	6.51	7.26	6	10.9	11.95	15.0	7.8	108

Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to the together her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents newhope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually succeed. In addition, in the text it says, “it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.” Saeng’s past memones could be reached when this hibiscus was in new and that served as immense inspiration to her.

6958	10519	4	The author concluded the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to portray to her reader that even though Saeng was experiencing a hardship leaving her old home behind, she could still find a good life with new beginning here. In the final paragraph the winter shows represent hard times in the past, while the spring represents a more optimistic future, and a new beginning. Although Saeng was grieving at the lass of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story she once knew hibiscus cran her did home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home. Also, the story says.” Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can appreciate happly live in this new home.

Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the “hibiscus is budding” then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready.	3	3		3																						183	12	206	9	0	0	4.286486486486487	15.416666666666666	42	21	14	15	6	28	107	7.3	6.78	7.05	22	6.2	8.17	8.666666666666666	8.8	242
7034	10598	4	Ii think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause the author is saying Its gonna be a @CAPS1 year or some change is gonna happen and he feels That could of did better than what they did and is gonna take that test again.	1	1		1																						46	1	50	0	0	0	4.1521739130434785	46.0	10	10	0	2	3	2	27	21.1	7.45	8.32	4	16.5	18.4	23.0	0.0	55
7045	10609	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is willing to give the test another try. She is now more open –minded about the situation. In the beginning of the story, Saeng was upset and annoyed about failing her driver’s test. For example, “the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I-I failed the test,” Saeng said to her mother. Obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself. The author didn’t want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending. Saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. For example, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” I believe that this attitude was because of the memorys of her mother country that soothes her and also her mother. In conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal.	2	3		3																						194	11	215	10	0	0	4.587628865979381	17.636363636363637	50	28	7	7	8	29	106	9.9	8.65	7.37	20	8.5	9.82	7.2857142857142865	10.1	269
7047	10611	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because when the snow melts and the geese return, she going to have higher confidence in taking and passing the test. After she failed the test later on in the story the geeses had flew away. So when the geese return the geese will remind her of what had just now happened. When the snow melts and spring comes the hibiscus flower will bloom once again.	1	1		1																						76	4	82	2	0	0	4.447368421052632	19.0	17	13	3	8	3	7	42	9.0	8.07	7.07	8	7.2	8.65	9.0	7.2	97
7051	10615	4	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotion connection to the memories and flashbacks that the Hibiscus brings back to her. At one point in the story, she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back aware of memories. Later on in the story, she takes the plant to her mother. At first @PERSON1 is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughter’s actions and feelings. Saeng is upset that she didn’t pass her test and her mother understands that. I think the author ends the story this way because wants the reader to see that because the hibiscuses is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, she will have a reason and motivation to continue and reach her goal of passing.	2	2		2																						134	6	144	4	0	0	4.582089552238806	22.333333333333332	36	19	7	6	7	17	76	11.3	9.12	8.16	19	9.6	11.31	8.833333333333334	11.5	190
7052	10616	4	Since it is getting close to winter the geese are going south. The plants are losing there leaves. Saeng says that she will take the test again. It seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds it will give her hope and confidence. Especially the hibiscus because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother, when she first saw it and held the leaf it brought a tear to her eye. And when it comes back next year it will rejuvinate her.	2	2		2																						85	6	92	1	0	0	4.317647058823529	14.166666666666666	18	13	3	6	5	9	53	6.0	6.72	6.94	7	4.1	7.09	6.916666666666667	8.3	105
7062	10626	4	The last paragraph of the story was: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that she is adapting and that she is starting to accept the change. I think that because throughout the story she is upset and not really liking the change. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” The text says. This last paragraph seems optimistic talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning which seems like she is starting to accept the change. In my opinion, the author added  that paragraph to finish the story to show that Saeng is starting to accept the change and be optimistic.	2	2		2																						146	7	159	6	0	0	4.578231292517007	21.0	31	25	8	4	7	16	84	18.5	9.47	8.04	15	14.0	15.7	17.666666666666668	10.1	192

7075	10639	4	The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomforalable. For example when she broke down in the flower shop. This shows that even though things can remind her of home it isn’t the same. You have to get used to and become accostumed to a new place. This also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test.	2	2		2																						78	5	83	0	0	0	4.102564102564102	15.6	11	13	6	4	1	7	53	5.7	5.86	6.23	4	4.7	7.78	7.4	7.6	94

Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" I think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy. His tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture. The author's tone was very sweet, I think, when thanking his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.... and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" The mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and sweet, thanks to the author."	4	4		4																						280	15	326	16	0	0	4.560714285714286	18.666666666666668	70	29	28	9	16	33	164	14.0	8.36	7.73	34	10.7	13.34	18.666666666666668	11.2	370

In conclusion the mood in the memoir Home: The @CAPS2 prints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is, happy, and greatful because of the sacrifices made by his parents.

In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay.Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong.

In a selection from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, he describes the mood, or the feeling created by an author, in his childhood one of family and people with helping hands. Narciso says that everybody in his neighbor hood were ""immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows helpfulness espically in a time when racism and segregation were big in the States. Secondly, their was a sense of family in all of the people at Narciso's house. There was often people staying in his house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. The Rodriguez's beilieved these people would do the same thing for them in return. Finally, Narciso can not express how grateful he is to have the importance of friends and family put on him so early in his life. Without his parents stressing the fact that family is not only your blood relatives, he would never have beilived that family and helping hands were so important. A mood of family qualities and helpfulness pre vails in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir."	4	3		4																						205	10	229	8	0	0	4.795121951219512	20.5	63	19	9	13	7	27	115	11.4	9.86	7.89	31	10.1	10.93	12.8	12.2	301
7426	12174	5	A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trails, struggles, and happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family is, that its much more than blood. It's unity, friendship and laughter, its the tears, pain and heartache. Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I deal with it to, I get called cracker and n**** on a daily baised, I dont know how I would get through it without family.	2	2		2																						158	7	190	15	0	0	4.5	22.571428571428573	41	18	3	6	13	22	102	11.1	8.07	7.46	15	9.7	10.81	9.0	11.5	214
7432	12180	5	The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think thats what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up. Narciso also talked about what kinds of things happened at his house when he was a kid. One thing he talked about was how his landlords daughter was his first babysitter and first friend. He also talked about how his parents showed him thier cooking skills and thier passion for cooking.	2	1		2																						84	5	90	0	0	0	4.416666666666667	16.8	19	13	4	2	3	6	52	7.8	7.71	7.85	10	6.3	6.72	7.6	5.7	106

3591	5986	3	The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” describes a man’s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard.	2	2		2																						92	7	102	3	0	0	4.695652173913044	13.142857142857142	26	12	5	9	0	16	47	8.4	8.69	7.83	15	6.9	7.86	7.833333333333334	9.3	132
3592	5987	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drain’s a person’s energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; “The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskie’s story, “Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.	2	3		3																						149	9	168	10	0	0	4.9865771812080535	16.555555555555557	48	25	11	10	1	26	64	11.4	10.79	7.53	22	9.4	10.66	12.8	12.2	221
3597	5992	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe kurmaksie,greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided.The old cotagers told him about a path they thought was right,but was hard and did not get him to the right place.The features of the setting are described as “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.”	1	1		1																						69	3	79	3	0	0	4.76056338028169	23.666666666666668	16	10	9	3	3	10	39	36.1	11.74	10.95	14	26.7	28.76	36.5	0.0	91

3610	6005	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way. This ways are pysical and mental. The pysical ways that features affect cyclist is the terrain. If the roads are long and wiredy, this could wear the cyclist out. They could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep. When it’s you against gravity, it can be egausting. The temperature can also be a crusal factor in a cyclist pysical ability. Nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding. The cyclist and also be attracted mentally. If the terrain looks deserted or anything like a desert the byciclist instintaniously thinks “dehydration” and “death.” If some people see dead animals or bones they would think they could die. If they see vulture circling them they would get afraid and think death, but the worse thing of all is that knowing all of these things are in the same place at the same time. This is how setting affects cyclists	3	2		3																						170	12	184	3	0	0	4.576470588235294	14.166666666666666	38	20	15	6	8	21	98	7.2	8.17	7.68	25	6.5	8.5	5.555555555555555	9.3	233
3618	6014	3	"The terrain during the cyclist’s journey greatly affects him. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing. The author stated, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This shows that he was energized and happy. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, especially because he had no water left. The cyclist said, “sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn.  This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are include, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did."	3	2		3																						157	8	179	13	0	0	4.822784810126582	19.75	32	20	15	12	6	25	86	14.5	10.33	7.75	22	12.3	13.54	11.6	11.9	230
3625	6021	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty. The bumpy roods and hills make him work harder. The abandoned places make him lose hope. If faced with these obstacles I would have been affected in the same way.

3627	6023	3	The three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling, the towns he passes, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is important because the rougher the terrain, and the more hills there are, the more energy he must use, and the less distance he can travel. @PERSON1 is riding fine until he must travel the rolling hills which consume his energy, ehausts his water, and causes dividing hope. As he approaches towns, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be unable of giving him relief. When he pumps out water that tastes like “battery acid,” his hope once again diminishes. As he sees the bait and tackle shop, he knows he can make it there and that when he gets there he can recover. These three features are what effects the cyclist the most.	2	2		2																						155	7	171	10	0	0	4.567741935483871	22.142857142857142	33	25	9	7	7	20	91	13.0	8.83	8.69	24	11.0	12.64	20.0	11.2	210
3628	6024	3	In the story of “rough road ahead :do not exceed posted limit” the setting affected the cyclist. In the middle of the desert during the summer the cyclist was low on water.

3632	6028	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” All the road was hills and rough. Than “The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.” @CAPS1 doesn’t have that much water. That was really hard.	2	1		2																						75	7	84	2	0	0	4.76	10.714285714285714	21	11	9	4	1	17	34	8.5	8.63	7.96	12	6.8	7.07	7.300000000000001	8.2	106
3637	6033	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the main character the cyclist. The cyclist is biking “through the high desert of california in June.” So naturally it can be infereal that it is not and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases “a tarlike substance followed by brackish water” he is runningout of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that “l cald drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service causing more anxiousness and dispare l have had an experience similar to this where l wat out walking in a state park in the @DATE1. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow covered trees made me feel at if I’d never be warm again similar to He cyclist who’s environment made him feel hes wald die of dehydration. So, as can be seen. He setting of this short story affects the cyclist.	3	3		3																						190	8	203	4	0	0	4.542105263157895	23.75	58	26	15	8	5	26	90	11.8	8.88	9.39	38	10.2	12.68	11.8	11.5	271
3638	6034	3	The settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don’t want to be near when you are out of water and tired from pedaling. The time and place affected him greatly because there wasn’t a cool breeze in the air in June at California. He was in the middle of flat deserts and had no sense of where the part as and where civilization too so he can get some water. The quote “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” helped you realize taking advice of direction from old people who don’t go anywhere is a bad idea. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”. This quote shows you some terrail features that affected the cyclist. Furthermore, the cyclist realivingly found civilization with running water.	2	2		2																						136	7	143	1	0	0	4.602941176470588	19.428571428571427	38	19	6	6	4	15	71	11.6	9.35	8.13	16	9.8	11.14	14.25	10.9	185

The example is when ""he stops and asks for directions to Yosemite state park"". Because he did what to get lost. When he had to and other towns.

3647	6043	3	The setting effected the cyclist in a great way. The snakes blocked his pathways, and hi short water supply made it hard to continue. He felt as if he could drop of a heatstroke. His environment, and the information from the old man made his ride very hard to continue. All in all, his settings had a big effect on him.	1	1		1																						61	5	69	3	0	0	4.245901639344262	12.2	14	9	5	5	2	7	34	4.7	5.67	7.61	10	4.5	7.5	6.1	8.8	81
3650	6046	3	Setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty not outside causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must have. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED @CAPS1. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isn’t much easier. Anothe way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought of to be a diamondback.	1	1		1																						105	7	119	6	0	0	4.438095238095238	15.0	22	20	4	7	1	15	58	8.2	7.36	7.96	17	6.6	8.52	8.0	8.3	141
3653	6049	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affected the cyclist.

3676	6072	3	In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. “Not two miles into the next section.” He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. “I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” It get harder and harder to continue his ride.	2	2		2																						91	10	100	2	0	0	4.593406593406593	9.1	22	13	14	2	1	15	47	11.6	8.88	8.41	16	9.8	10.88	12.375	8.8	129
3680	6076	3	There are @NUM1 features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobody’s there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist.  Furthermore he’s in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about @NUM2 or @NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobody’s around town in able to help him out or anything. Let’s say that he gets lost and he’ll need direction to get wherever he’s going well there’s nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the @NUM1 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																						198	14	216	4	0	0	4.35678391959799	14.214285714285714	39	27	10	15	10	22	124	7.4	7.19	6.37	15	6.2	7.61	4.888888888888889	7.8	257

Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory” This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited. Lastly, the text states, “GRAPE AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP” The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink.

One of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in. while he was lost, thirsty, and exhausted, he remained all the while in “The high deserts of California in June”. This shows that the temperature most of been unbearable. This would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate faster than usual. Also, the surface he was riding on had many steep hills, as it is said when he says “over one long, crippling hill,” This shows that the hills took a lot of energy to get up. And finally, the author says that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This shows that if he needed help, there was no one around to lend him a hand.

3720	6116	3	The features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist. He is going on this bike ride through the deserts of “california in June. This obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very fast. At one point he says, ‘The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed.” @CAPS1, the setting of having all these ghost towns was troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beggining to rum out of water.  The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” When your petalling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you. If he was in a different setting this felling of despair would not be      in the story.

3726	6122	3	During the cyclist bike ride the unbearable conditions changed his attitude when he firsts starts the reader can sense frustration because of the old timers and there directions. Then as he realizes that he might have enough water his attitude changes. The cyclist goes from frustrated to loving the secenery, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,” as the conditions changed to even more unbearable heat. He decided to just give up. Until he got courage and “slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” When he saw Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he realized he was safe.	2	2		2																						104	5	111	3	0	0	4.903846153846154	20.8	24	21	8	7	4	12	53	12.0	10.68	9.07	15	9.0	12.17	12.6	12.7	145
3739	6135	3	This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills. Another example would be “high deserts of California in June.” That’s saying its hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the “summer time” its very tiring. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																						99	6	105	1	0	0	4.404040404040404	16.5	21	14	8	3	3	11	58	9.2	7.78	7.01	10	8.7	8.73	11.1	9.4	134
3741	6137	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink.	2	2		2																						141	4	147	2	0	0	4.411347517730497	35.25	36	19	11	2	3	6	76	17.0	8.66	7.96	17	13.5	16.11	18.0	12.2	188

Then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweed and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by. Then at the end she came upon “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” where she decided to make decisions herself.

Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate.

In the essay, he describes the weather with “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” While this @MONTH1 not directly characterice the weather, the reader can confin a clear image of the sweltering heat of a desert in the summer. When the author comes across the “ghost town” followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read “Rough Road Ahead,” his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”"	3	3		3																						183	6	199	9	0	0	4.786885245901639	30.5	47	28	7	4	5	25	97	16.4	10.46	8.51	32	12.8	15.92	15.25	13.6	261

3782	6178	3	In this essay, the features of the setting cause the cyclist to become irritaed toward the old men. Ten this essay, old men give the cyclist direction, and instead of using a map, he takes their advice. However their information is out of date, and takes the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist uses all of his energy to get to unknown towns of no importance, and with no water. The cyclist blame the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy. However he showed realy become himself for taking their advice, and motuising a credited map on real directions.	2	3		3																						105	6	118	7	0	0	4.666666666666667	17.5	29	16	7	3	5	14	56	9.3	8.76	7.81	15	8.9	9.67	9.0	11.2	156
3786	6182	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summer’s day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, “.I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except “Old timers who haven’t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing” (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor. It can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting.	2	3		3																						171	9	193	9	0	0	4.631578947368421	19.0	50	18	9	4	0	23	94	9.9	8.7	7.81	21	8.3	9.47	8.333333333333334	10.3	234
3793	6189	3	The features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing. It might make you want to go faster and left out your inner speed demon. That’s all I can really tell you. Because personally I don’t think the setting of where you ride your bike doesn’t even matter. Possibly for a bicyclist it can, but to me I don’t even think so.	1	1		1																						67	5	74	2	0	0	4.298507462686567	13.4	10	12	1	8	2	10	43	5.5	6.43	7.6	8	5.0	7.15	6.5	8.2	88
3794	6190	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there are no cars, building, water, or people in sight. It goes from flat road to rolling hills. Even though he had no water he was determined to keep pedeling. “Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit” At this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation I would feel hopeless. There was no sign of hope. He just saw endless rolling hills and that was all. Then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free. So he pedeled up to the building, and that with all the others was abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die. In conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope. If he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case. He is in the middle of nowhere. He finally came to bend and say “Then, as easily as randing a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.”	2	2		2																						203	15	225	9	0	0	4.246305418719212	13.533333333333333	42	28	9	14	8	24	125	6.4	6.38	6.59	21	5.8	7.62	6.428571428571429	7.6	256
3797	6193	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun. The heat dyhydrates and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor. It takes up the time and energy he has to preform. Another key ingreedient of the setting was the desert. There was no one to help him and there wasn't a place to get water. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story.	1	1		1																						74	8	84	1	0	0	4.256756756756757	9.25	18	11	4	4	3	11	46	3.3	4.84	6.66	10	4.6	5.88	4.25	7.6	102
3801	6197	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist. One setting that affected him was the first setting. I this setting he used up his water and it was hot. this affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die. The text shoud this when it said “I could drop from heat stroke”, later when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory he thought about how thirsty he was. This affected him because usually when you think about thirst you get thirsty er. This also made him dis apointed. The finale setting affected him because he had finally got water and wasn’t thirsty. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						131	9	143	2	0	0	4.580152671755725	14.555555555555555	25	28	6	5	3	16	70	8.3	8.47	7.22	14	7.3	7.78	11.4	9.5	180

The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride.” I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men.” Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information. But not the land has changed and the directions were wrong. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help.

He had to ride his bike up and down hills several times which wears you out very quickly”. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, “After he got threw the hills, he came to a sigh “ ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT”.  Now he has to go through bumply roads. “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me”. Now the poor guy had to deal with snakes bigger than him! Thankfully he got by the snake, alive. “Over one long cripping hill, a building came into view”.

3836	6232	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting is an all- important factor. The author feels the need to describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details each place he stops, such as in “one ramshackle shed…and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule…” and “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite…” In a story such as this setting is of great importance especially since it is so rapidly changing. The story itself would be of much different quality likely for a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past, this story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is.	1	1		1																						128	4	138	5	0	0	4.267175572519084	32.75	32	12	14	7	4	15	67	20.5	8.55	8.96	17	16.4	18.33	19.0	12.5	172
3841	6237	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned “@PERSON1’s Grape Juice” factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets “old timers and the give him a “shortcut” to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their “shortcut.” While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. “It din’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.	2	2		2																						163	9	173	0	0	0	4.060975609756097	18.22222222222222	31	31	7	8	7	19	99	9.4	6.22	7.5	13	8.8	10.06	11.0	8.8	204
3850	6246	3	The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes “that the old men would have been right,had he been riding,” before the last word war.” But any “town” he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says,“It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, But “hope was fading.” Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who haven’t moved from their front porches in years.	1	1		1																						157	8	177	15	0	0	4.337579617834395	19.625	27	27	18	11	9	32	91	12.1	7.26	7.85	15	10.0	11.75	14.25	9.3	199
3852	6248	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hottnes of the deserts of California because the cyclist was sweating, and drinking his water bottles.

The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, “he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless” when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now “behind” him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist’s physical and mental state.

3903	6299	3	Whether the lack of water, the hills, the tumble weeds – all are things that affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water. The hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills. Finally is the tumbleweeds. The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look. When he sees tumble weeds he try’s to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn’t want to crash. The dehydration / lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive. When you are lack of water and energy it makes your goal more hard to complete.	2	2		2																						115	8	125	2	0	0	4.452173913043478	14.375	29	18	7	6	4	13	59	6.8	7.59	7.67	13	6.5	7.47	7.0	8.5	159
3904	6300	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, “I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved @NUM1). Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, “Telling myself that of I could make it that far, I’d be @NUM3). The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist.	3	3		3																						153	7	177	13	0	0	4.738562091503268	21.857142857142858	39	24	8	10	9	26	79	11.8	9.17	9.26	29	9.5	11.37	14.75	10.3	218
3920	6316	3	The features of the setting affects the setting by all the big hills, and all the roughness of the roads. As the essay says ''flatroad was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I crested the first few of these a large highway sigh jumped out at me,” prety much what it is saying is the flat road soon turned into rolling hills. If I was the cyclist riding up the hills my legs would get very tired and sore after a while one example, is when my friend ,@PERSON1, and I went  bike riding, we went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, in fechmisburg, and we had to ride up a big hill, so after a few pedals our legs started hurting, so we decided to just walk go the hill.	1	1		1																						128	4	144	11	0	0	4.077519379844961	32.25	32	18	11	6	4	16	73	13.9	6.22	8.55	19	12.2	13.74	12.75	8.1	160

3935	6331	3	The features of california and the fact that the cyclist was neave Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous to the cyclist california has a very hot climate, and is neove  a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater man if the had been cyclist in @LOCATION1. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to “ short, rolling hills,” which would have made it harder to pedal, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mention how the sun was beating down on him, and that would alos serve as a factor thout helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problem the cyclist faced nowever, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through.

3937	6333	3	The cyclist in the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to @CAPS1 national park. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The fist town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with dipleted water, @CAPS2 sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory. He had made it to a bait store for water at last. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again.	2	3		3																						121	8	131	2	0	0	4.132231404958677	15.125	31	15	9	10	3	14	67	5.6	5.5	7.26	16	5.6	6.7	6.857142857142857	7.6	154

3944	6340	3	"The story Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclist’s mood was detirmined by the setting as well as his needs and his detirmination to make it. The setting of the story early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of @CAPS1 can June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men’s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his detirmination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he’d] be fine."" @CAPS2 for the cyclist, the settings affect was negitive."	3	2		3																						153	9	185	7	0	0	4.8431372549019605	17.0	36	21	11	13	1	32	84	10.9	9.52	8.2	26	8.4	9.99	7.428571428571429	10.1	221
3957	6353	3	As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldn’t have trusted but did any way. This led him through the desert. Even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water op one will be there to save you from dehydration. Just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a roll in the cyclist feelings. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water. Every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact. For example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water. Finally just when his strength was to give out he found the bait place & water and that dramatically and a place to rest too bad there was another old man there, isn’t it?!	2	3		3																						164	10	178	3	1	1	4.152439024390244	16.4	35	21	13	15	6	14	98	6.4	6.15	7.25	16	6.1	7.99	7.0	8.8	208
3960	6356	3	SETTING WAS A IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE STORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT THERE IS A LACK OF WATER. AND ME WAS IN A BIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS.

3962	6358	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly was incorrect and he got lost. The lack of water led to the possibility to sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst. The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy.These were the affects the setting had to the cyclist.	2	1		2																						58	5	64	0	0	0	4.593220338983051	11.8	16	10	3	0	1	4	31	7.8	8.75	8.71	11	6.6	9.25	7.5	9.5	84

3968	6364	3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He can’t say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him he’ll die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and that’s like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.	2	3		3																						147	6	154	0	0	0	4.238095238095238	24.5	37	22	10	9	2	10	85	10.8	7.38	7.43	10	8.1	10.89	13.0	7.8	183
3971	6367	3	In this story, “No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, by be Joe Kurmaskie I believe the setting greatly affect the cyclist. I believe this because when it’s long downhill cool roads is fine but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he can’t keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around so the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story.

3981	6377	3	In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first “town” he is not too worried about it and moves on. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.” @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked “and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.” @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didn’t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the author’s moods.	3	3		3																						218	10	242	10	0	0	4.408256880733945	21.8	47	36	16	21	10	35	118	14.9	8.14	8.8	31	11.9	13.91	12.75	10.6	291
3984	6380	3	There are many ways the setting affected the cyclist in this story like the weather, supply of food and water, wrong estimation for old people and the road. First off the weather was was very dry and it was two hundred degrees, so it made you sweat and hard to breath. The supply of water was harsh not much around at all and when he tryed to get water the pumps would pump out not water. The weather and water supply were two maijor affects on the cyclist.	1	1		1																						88	4	95	3	0	0	4.204545454545454	22.0	24	8	6	6	6	8	53	9.4	6.67	6.7	7	8.3	9.71	11.5	7.2	113
3987	6383	3	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, “short, rolling hills”, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isn’t much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble.	2	2		2																						101	6	112	5	0	0	4.366336633663367	16.833333333333332	26	15	8	5	5	12	59	7.6	7.13	6.97	11	6.3	8.7	8.333333333333334	8.8	134
3990	6386	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel”. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “ From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part.	2	2		2																						184	11	206	6	0	0	4.2771739130434785	16.727272727272727	41	27	10	14	6	23	118	10.2	7.09	6.84	19	8.7	10.5	8.0	9.8	243
3992	6388	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 the heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.	3	2		3																						174	8	191	11	0	0	4.494252873563219	21.75	39	26	13	11	3	22	100	12.1	8.36	7.5	21	9.5	12.26	14.25	10.6	233
3995	6391	3	The setting effected the cyclist by the rough roads, the cylist having a hard time pedaling over the roads. The snake, the cyclist got scared of the snake on his ride through the “town.” The fact he was running out of water and the water he found tasted like battery acid. The setting was very rough on the cyclist.	1	1		1																						59	4	64	2	0	0	4.3559322033898304	14.75	18	7	4	1	1	7	29	8.9	7.37	7.02	5	7.4	9.24	10.5	7.8	74
4013	6409	3	There were many different conditions that effected the cyclist. He did not have the proper ammount of water for the journey witch made it difficult. He states in the story, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1 the terrain and hills made it difficult. He ran into snakes and very deserted country. But his determination led to success and arrived into a town	2	2		2																						66	6	71	1	0	0	4.863636363636363	11.0	18	10	8	2	4	7	35	8.1	9.44	8.12	13	8.4	8.92	7.199999999999999	10.4	103
4014	6410	3	"In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first “town” that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist “chuckled and moved on”, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached “the fork of sorts” twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men’s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."	3	3		3																						233	8	261	17	0	0	4.412017167381975	29.125	59	35	19	11	7	36	123	13.9	8.14	8.26	34	12.3	13.87	13.25	10.7	316
4016	6412	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you can’t see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.	1	1		1																						188	5	193	0	0	0	3.648936170212766	37.6	34	26	6	7	6	8	130	14.6	4.31	6.76	6	12.1	15.47	17.0	7.6	208
4019	6415	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, the high deserts of California affected him. Also, “Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change.” For example flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then after over coming that, “A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55. Last the author says, “Sometimes life can feelso cruel.

4029	6425	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist. “I maneuvered down the hill.” This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would hawe been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy.

4037	6433	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist more tired and thirsty. The rolling hills where he had to pedal up and down and the desert with no water in sight just dry land. Everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story. The old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory,is like drinks are right there but are now gone. If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he would’ve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings. The tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died. Everything in the story was the opposite of what he wanted until he got to his last hope the bait shop.	2	1		2																						130	8	141	2	0	0	4.446153846153846	16.25	32	14	11	8	8	12	75	7.7	7.77	7.48	12	6.1	7.75	7.0	8.8	167
4038	6434	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us “…I was travelling through the high deserts of California  in June.” The extreme heat of the summer definitely put a  strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water . Unfortonatly the  “towns” were very far apart and many not having good water making dehydration  problem. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.” @CAPS1 of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map.	2	2		2																						124	6	137	4	0	0	4.294573643410852	21.5	35	16	6	6	4	19	64	20.1	8.95	9.01	20	16.9	19.0	19.0	12.5	175
4048	6444	3	The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men’s “town” was now abandoned. “…(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled…” This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When “a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a “sad, hopeless laugh.” The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water.	3	3		3																						144	9	162	6	0	0	4.304054054054054	16.444444444444443	29	21	18	10	4	21	74	9.8	7.95	7.53	15	8.8	10.37	11.2	10.0	197

WHEN THE HILLS GOT BIGGER AND HARDER TO PEDAI, HE BEGAN TO GET EXHAUSTED AND TIRED. LASTLY, THE BUILDINGS WERE WHAT MADE HIM WANT TO GIVE UP. WHEN HE SEES THE BUILDING OF THE WELCH’S GRAPE JUICE FACTORY AND THE YOUNG BOY DRINKING HE “HUNG HIS HEAD.” HE WAS GETTING MORE TIRED AS HE WENT ALONG.

4052	6448	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and he was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the “ghost town” and bait shop he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story.	2	2		2																						116	5	132	7	1	0	4.586206896551724	23.2	30	14	4	3	7	18	70	11.8	8.88	7.24	12	8.8	11.0	13.5	9.4	154

4061	6457	3	In this essay features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite makes it worse. Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn’t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn’t have water he couldn’t funcation as well as if he was hydrated.	2	2		2																						137	5	146	4	0	0	4.2773722627737225	27.4	28	19	12	12	4	15	80	12.4	7.43	8.45	15	10.4	12.71	10.6	9.4	181
4063	6459	3	In this story, the cyclist had to ride threw the desert, during june and with little water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates alot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him. Personally I don’t know what he was doing ride threw the dessert by himself, and that’s his problem.	2	2		2																						71	4	78	3	0	0	4.352112676056338	17.75	13	14	4	2	3	9	42	7.9	7.07	7.41	8	6.7	8.25	8.375	7.2	90
4070	6466	3	The cyclist in ”Rough road Ahead” was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 it’s usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isn’t an easy trick.	1	2		2																						126	6	138	5	0	0	3.984126984126984	21.0	23	17	9	10	9	16	77	7.8	5.28	6.81	9	7.9	9.67	11.2	9.3	161
4071	6467	3	The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says “the bulding abandoned years earlier.” If I was him I would of turned around and went back so I would take the chance of not dieing out in the middle of an abandoned area.	1	1		1																						81	5	85	0	0	0	3.950617283950617	16.2	18	12	1	1	1	6	52	7.3	5.28	7.57	8	6.5	9.11	10.375	6.0	95
4078	6474	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn’t even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. “The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.” (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.	2	2		2																						177	12	197	2	0	0	4.581920903954802	14.75	42	29	12	13	5	24	93	10.0	8.36	8.18	24	8.6	10.59	11.8	10.5	250
4080	6476	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions	3	2		3																						176	13	197	6	0	0	4.1477272727272725	13.538461538461538	38	22	12	7	9	19	113	4.9	5.44	6.64	15	3.8	6.31	5.75	6.7	213

4096	6492	3	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts olwing the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water decive his trip, but he was mistaken. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The setting affected the cyclist’s mood in a negative way.	2	2		2																						85	6	93	2	0	0	4.905882352941177	14.166666666666666	23	9	7	4	2	11	48	8.8	10.03	8.61	17	7.6	9.92	7.583333333333334	10.1	130
4097	6493	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. It stated, “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was  pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along. Also it stated,” At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down. There was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy.	2	2		2																						102	7	115	3	0	0	4.660194174757281	14.714285714285714	27	19	6	4	5	14	52	9.2	8.81	7.73	13	7.6	9.15	8.666666666666666	10.1	140
4101	6497	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead.” First, the scorching heat of the desert  in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of dehydration. In the text it states, “I could drop from heatstroke in a gorgeous day in June (@CAPS1).” This shows the effect the exposure  to heat had on @NUM1 cyclist. Also, the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story. In the text it says “I toiled on( @CAPS2).” This shows the increase in effort in strain the  terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure.	2	2		2																						101	4	113	3	0	0	4.355769230769231	26.0	33	13	5	1	0	15	54	12.2	7.9	8.8	15	9.6	11.31	13.25	8.8	135
4106	6502	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a few different ways. At first it helped him. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers” This is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun. Later on the setting was against him. There was no place to get water and he was becoming dehydrated the terrain was getting rougher. There were no people around to help him, but there was a snake. All these features were working against him until he finally made it to a bait store. This bait store gave him water and a good map.	2	2		2																						107	9	118	2	0	0	4.327102803738318	11.88888888888889	22	19	5	5	6	12	63	5.7	6.6	6.66	10	5.0	6.11	6.0	8.1	138
4112	6508	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist’s own words, “ things began well enough.” @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, “got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.” He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him.	2	2		2																						106	5	120	10	0	0	4.452830188679245	21.2	26	17	7	7	5	21	56	12.8	7.78	8.82	16	10.1	12.49	13.75	9.5	138
4119	6515	3	Setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition. If the road condition is bad then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night. If it is night, they must be careful due to cars not being able to see them. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous to cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water.	1	1		1																						81	7	92	2	0	0	4.246913580246914	11.571428571428571	18	9	7	3	1	10	51	4.4	5.43	5.97	6	4.3	5.63	5.357142857142857	7.4	107
4130	6526	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him.

4140	6536	3	Heat, water supply, energy-all are features of setting that can affect a cyclist. First, is heat. When it is too warm out it makes it more difficult, and more inconvenient to ride. Second, is your water supply. If you are riding, and begin to run low on water, your in trouble. The author describes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. If you arn’t prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Lastly, is energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. “With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” the author describes. When you are out of energy, your ride is over. all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey.	2	2		2																						150	12	178	15	0	0	4.62	12.5	31	22	9	11	4	31	88	7.2	7.82	6.94	20	7.4	7.57	4.9	9.8	219

4150	6546	3	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author tells a story about when he took advice from “old folks” and became lost. The setting greatly affected him and his journey, for example “tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake…” and a “crippling hill” these quotes explain that the setting was quite scary.	1	1		1																						58	2	64	4	0	0	4.762711864406779	29.5	18	8	4	3	4	14	26	15.9	10.8	8.89	10	12.2	14.36	16.5	0.0	80
4155	6551	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows features of the setting played that affects the cyclist in many different ways. A setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking (drinking) water, and worrying that he is going to run out. Kurmaskie writes, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in @NUM1). This is what the cyclist gets affected by throuout the whole story as he releizes he could die of heatstroke if he dosent watch how much water hes drinking. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration.	2	2		2																						122	5	136	5	0	0	4.549180327868853	24.4	29	21	9	5	2	17	62	12.2	8.71	9.12	19	10.4	12.38	14.5	11.2	171
4161	6557	3	Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking to much of his water. So when he stoped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water their. He started his ride the the roads were hilly and short. Then the road turned into bumpy to. So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way.	1	1		1																						96	6	103	1	0	0	4.145833333333333	16.0	20	12	7	4	4	7	59	6.1	6.03	6.9	8	6.0	7.65	7.666666666666666	7.8	120
4162	6558	3	The character in this short story has a most that changes with his surroundings. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said ‘’ The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,’’ As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher.	1	1		1																						64	4	67	1	0	0	4.369230769230769	16.25	14	12	4	1	3	5	39	15.4	8.72	8.92	10	13.4	16.55	19.5	0.0	87
4179	6576	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren’t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat.	2	2		2																						99	6	110	3	0	0	4.343434343434343	16.5	23	14	8	6	4	13	59	7.3	6.96	7.8	13	7.4	8.22	8.25	8.8	135
4181	6578	3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes because he couldn’t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey.	3	2		3																						92	7	103	2	0	0	4.880434782608695	13.142857142857142	26	12	8	6	0	15	44	9.2	9.68	8.86	17	8.1	9.16	8.333333333333334	10.5	139
4183	6580	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldn’t have taken the old mens advise. He explains that “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself.	2	2		2																						147	7	161	5	0	0	4.401360544217687	21.0	30	22	9	10	2	19	82	11.5	7.96	8.4	24	10.5	12.52	11.6	11.2	205

4193	6590	3	The feature of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. He was a California desert in the month of June. There was no water in the desert so he had to use the water he had. He says the sun began taking harder ran and the terrain turned into short rolling hills. The hills made him work harder which dehydrate him guccher.and since there was no water in the desert, he could have died of dehydration	2	2		2																						75	5	80	1	0	0	4.333333333333333	15.0	18	14	3	2	1	6	42	6.5	6.78	7.33	10	5.6	8.67	7.300000000000001	8.2	99
4197	6594	3	"Many things in the setting of the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affected the cyclist throughout his journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a deserts without a good supply of water. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the length of his journey. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist."	1	1		1																						80	4	85	0	0	0	4.825	20.0	23	7	5	4	1	5	46	11.3	10.33	7.98	14	8.7	9.5	11.75	10.7	115
4203	6600	3	In this story, the cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite, California. In the begining, the cyclist was sure of himself he decided to ask some old men that looked like they haven't been off their porch since Carter was in office for directions. The old men ended up leading him into the middle of the desert. In the desert, the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water. There was no sign of civilization what so ever. These hot conditions made the cyclist very hot, tired, and very thirsty. But that didn't stop him, he kept going and eventually he came apon a little town where he could drink cool water and take a well needed rest.	2	3		3																						125	7	141	7	0	0	4.288	17.857142857142858	25	18	10	7	5	15	76	7.7	6.55	6.8	14	6.7	9.72	7.142857142857142	9.2	164
4206	6603	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, for example, the heat was unberable beating down on him during this long ride. The fact that he had no where around him to fill up his water bottle. So he was deing of thirst and he didn’t know where he was going or how far he had to go. The setting was crushal in this story.	1	1		1																						65	4	71	2	0	0	3.9846153846153847	16.25	13	8	3	2	2	9	42	5.4	4.99	6.87	5	6.1	8.37	7.875	8.1	82
4222	6619	3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclists state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it is summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early @DATE1. And third he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together. He was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These @NUM1 things all contributed to the characters state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, that tasted like battery acid. He drank to much water at the begining which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough.	3	2		3																						167	12	182	3	0	0	4.209580838323354	13.916666666666666	34	22	13	13	4	16	102	5.4	5.97	5.93	11	4.0	7.24	5.333333333333333	8.1	205

The littlest thing that could through you off is the line when it says before the last world war.

4230	6627	3	The rider in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider “rode into the morning...with a smile” because of the bright sun, and the “cool pines” and rushing rivers”...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the “ramshackle shed...” And the “...sight of this was troubling...” to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the “crippling hills” that maybe this wasn’t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the “modern bathroom” that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through.	2	2		2																						126	6	147	7	0	0	4.5	21.333333333333332	31	13	10	7	5	30	74	15.8	8.66	8.46	13	12.0	14.5	14.5	11.2	161
4235	6632	3	Setting  depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didn’t. The cyclist  got a bad idea or aditude when he saw the towns he was upset and mad he didn’t want to die and yet he though. He was going two. He said he wouldn’t trust old men anymore. They didn’t know where were talking about .How and why did he trust even in the first place.	2	2		2																						76	8	85	0	0	0	3.858974358974359	9.75	12	17	6	4	5	12	43	2.5	3.75	6.46	5	2.8	4.36	4.428571428571429	3.1	91
4240	6637	3	The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he’s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a “ghost town” where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn’t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It’s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn’t find water yet. It doesn’t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosen’t find water.	2	3		3																						164	8	174	2	0	0	4.317073170731708	20.5	38	30	8	10	5	18	89	9.2	7.37	7.54	17	7.7	9.42	8.5	8.8	214
4241	6638	3	The setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was based in the hot, and dry terrain of California. This setting affected the character mood. It did this because some of its included feature can seem as actual metaphorically based moods. An example from the story is, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite...” this quote from the story could suggest the tone and the mood of the scenery which would be calm, and relaxed. So from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood.	2	2		2																						98	5	108	3	0	0	4.510204081632653	19.6	25	13	6	4	5	11	55	9.6	8.24	8.64	15	7.4	10.7	11.4	10.4	132
4243	6640	3	I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being a long, hot, lonely ride there, had an effect on him. It scared him which made him go longer. He had nothing to drink and thought he was going to die it made him weak. The snake in the way caused him longer and every stop that had once there effected him to.	1	1		1																						68	5	76	3	0	0	3.9558823529411766	13.6	9	14	5	4	2	8	44	4.0	4.4	6.4	5	3.9	6.03	6.0	5.7	80

4254	6651	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all he is travelling through a desert in California in June so the weather is extremely hot and the cyclist needs water, however as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water himself so he is thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, if frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot it tastes like battery acid @CAPS1, when the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, but there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, that the cyclist cannot go more that 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town. he still will have to wait longer for the much needed water, travelling at 12 mph. The snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape. Thus his major concern is the lack of water.	3	3		3																						170	8	189	9	0	0	4.323529411764706	21.25	33	22	12	16	4	13	109	11.1	7.49	7.44	19	10.4	11.13	18.333333333333332	10.0	234
4264	6661	3	In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,“The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.” This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn’t care if he died. From the author’s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																						157	10	170	4	0	0	4.273885350318471	15.7	32	26	6	11	4	18	92	8.5	6.96	8.13	20	7.4	9.88	8.166666666666666	8.8	205

The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.”The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,” in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. ”I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey."	3	3		3																						180	6	200	8	0	0	4.616666666666666	30.0	49	22	9	13	4	25	97	18.3	9.24	9.11	33	15.0	15.96	18.666666666666668	12.0	252

First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men who’s directions were out of date. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist.

4300	6697	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left. The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town. The setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much.	2	2		2																						103	5	109	1	0	0	4.029126213592233	20.6	17	17	6	6	1	6	71	7.9	5.75	6.8	8	7.8	9.02	10.8	8.2	132
4301	6698	3	Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate.

4309	6706	3	The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront  nature. when he began his trip with advice from “old coggers” he “ rode out with strong legs and a smile.” As he came to the first town, he describes it as a “ghost town” having no water and no human contact for some time. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rods on. Through the miles he incountered a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps, snakes,and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his “inner spirit” and caused his dehydration to further. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation.	2	2		2																						130	8	144	5	0	0	4.488549618320611	16.375	37	17	10	2	7	23	70	10.7	8.36	8.48	18	8.2	10.22	10.8	9.3	169
4314	6711	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldn’t get water from anywhere because he was in a dessert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty camps. Second, there were short rolling hills, and rough roads which made it hard to ride on. There were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes. The heat made it hard to keep riding. And there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water.

4329	6726	3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly effected by his surroundings. First, he described a beating sun and pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent. The setting is active just like the cyclist. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad souding corral. When these old, forsaken things one mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair.

4330	6727	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting is able to affect the cyclists emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways. As the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved showing positive influence but the pump oozes a shine like substance he referrs to as tasting like “battery acid” changing his mood for the worst. Finally, the pebbles he puts in his math show is desperation and willingness to try anything to survive show a new posotive outlook on the desert until a pump “lodges are in his thro at” making yet another negative influence. All of these feature lead him on his way to “Gary and will fish camp” and grounded an extra boost on his journey through the desert.	3	3		3																						159	5	165	1	0	0	4.515723270440252	31.8	42	18	14	7	9	15	82	15.8	9.3	8.99	25	13.3	14.23	14.75	12.7	222
4343	6740	3	In this story it is clear how difficult the cyclists journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions, lack of water, rattle snakes and fear of dieng. However he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. “This shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When finding this building to be abandoned, and all things, juice, anyone use would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination. And it paid off in the end he found his water and survived.

4359	6756	3	The main features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the fact that it was June and the dessert heat. “… I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June….” (kurmaskie @NUM1). This helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of California dessert. This affected the cyclist by his dehydration and the fact that he was inthe middle of no where with no one to help him. This is how the month of June and the dessert heat affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																						92	6	101	0	0	0	4.0638297872340425	15.666666666666666	29	7	3	1	3	10	52	9.6	6.45	7.18	8	8.7	11.37	13.25	10.7	115

This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, “This sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1).

4367	6764	3	Each new feature of the setting in the essay entilled, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the cyclist in some way. For example, in the text , when the narrator stated that he had to avoid a “ ridiculously large snake “crossing the road, he became more aware of his surroundings and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until he finally abided the large reptile. Also in the text, when, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” hope was replenished into the cyclist. This hope allowed the narrator to because more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building. Eighther for better or worse, a few feature of the setting arrives and affects the cyclist every step of his journey.	3	2		3																						133	5	147	12	0	0	4.646616541353383	26.6	36	18	11	7	3	21	68	13.8	9.41	8.18	21	11.2	12.38	14.5	10.4	187
4370	6767	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. First since he was in a desert, the heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his journey to the parts. Also, the bumpy roads and rolling hills slowed the bike down to 12 mph since it was to extreme for him to handle at high speeds. When he sees the fist building because he fist is relived but soon after he loses all his hope because it is desserted. Even the old men that living in the area have an affect on the cyclist because they give him out-dated directions that almost @CAPS1 him. Because of this, he will probably rest first an old man’s short tentS again. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						128	7	140	3	0	0	4.3359375	18.285714285714285	26	16	6	12	2	13	78	8.2	7.31	8.0	14	6.9	8.88	11.0	8.8	167
4378	6775	3	The setting was a hot desert in California that a biker got stuck in going to Yosemite National Park. These settings were hard on the cyclist. For example, he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed. He was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off. All of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though. He learn that just because they are old and looks wise they have information probably older than the artifacts at a museum. Besides he has a trust map: He got a lot from this trip.	2	2		2																						110	7	119	1	0	0	4.1909090909090905	15.714285714285714	24	16	8	3	3	9	62	6.2	6.26	7.0	15	5.9	8.83	7.142857142857142	8.8	142
4384	6781	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting the cyclsit is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. “But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because has eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. “After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read:ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challamging for the cyclsit. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, he’s relieved.	2	2		2																						199	12	225	11	0	0	4.457286432160804	16.583333333333332	44	33	14	10	1	32	109	12.0	8.13	7.89	27	10.6	11.97	14.5	10.4	272

4396	6793	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the old guys had worn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road.

4400	6797	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they caused him to need water. He was worn out because the setting was so intense. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” This quote from the text shows that the cyclists terrain was changing and they affected him.	2	2		2																						64	4	70	2	0	0	4.65625	16.0	15	11	4	1	1	8	34	11.2	9.17	9.13	11	8.1	9.15	11.0	6.4	85

4405	6802	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because it’s hot, and than theres no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” (@NUM1.). This exert from the test supports my previous statement about how it’s hot because the speaker tells us how he’s sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage. “There was no one insight not a building, car, or any structure of any kind” (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance.	2	2		2																						127	6	145	3	0	0	4.25	21.333333333333332	31	18	5	5	4	17	78	14.6	7.32	8.7	15	11.0	13.66	17.333333333333332	8.1	158
4408	6805	3	The features of a setting could be a number of different things. It could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, breezy and humid. The features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. The setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. In the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. These have been what I believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist.	2	3		3																						207	10	224	7	0	0	4.1980676328502415	20.7	43	27	24	2	13	16	121	8.7	6.62	7.26	19	7.8	8.86	7.833333333333334	7.9	259
4410	6807	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the person who rode the  bike was very tired his legs and body needed a rest after riding on his bike for @NUM1 miles into the pedal. Also it effected the cyclist because of all the riding he had to do struggleing to get where he was trying to get but he was a strong man and he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling. He was also restless but he did it.	1	1		1																						84	5	88	0	0	0	3.9647058823529413	17.0	18	12	4	3	4	6	55	11.4	5.93	7.66	10	10.7	12.63	15.0	8.8	111
4413	6810	3	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappoint, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally when he passes a portrin the road with nothing but a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral…” he becomes disturbed.  The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, “doing a water-deleting @NUM1.” The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, “ironic twist” the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist.	3	2		3																						142	6	159	8	0	0	4.736111111111111	24.0	38	18	11	8	4	23	74	18.9	10.46	9.29	28	16.0	16.45	19.0	13.4	212
4414	6811	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit.” In the beginining when the cyclists had just begun his cycling cause he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says “the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. “ When he says this the reader imagines someone in an ??? more excited as ??? ??? ??? ??? his destination on a dry day.  As the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what ?? ?? then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen when the cyclist says, “I wiped the swear from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage and that not to get too excited” the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall as the setting changes to “burning sun” and extremely hot, with a shortage of water the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upheat. For example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states “with only luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting.	3	3		3																						219	11	243	3	0	19	4.404545454545454	20.0	50	30	13	13	5	25	117	21.3	9.24	9.09	30	17.5	19.04	18.666666666666668	13.0	300
4416	6813	3	The feature of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described which implies that the biker probably had a hard time half way through the story he said, “Flat road was replaced by shor, rolling hills.” He said this to describe the difficulty in this race. It also makes it seem exciting because it changes things around. It wouldn’t be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didn’t show the terrain change at all.	1	1		1																						87	4	93	3	0	0	4.540229885057471	21.75	21	16	6	6	1	10	45	14.5	9.18	8.89	10	11.1	12.52	15.833333333333334	9.7	116
4421	6818	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point.	3	2		3																						160	5	171	6	0	0	4.4125	32.0	41	24	6	6	5	16	88	19.3	8.48	9.17	28	16.5	17.25	26.5	10.1	218

4429	6826	3	The features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony. As the cyclist continues down his path he pasts through a ghost town, then twenty mile up the road he sees a ramshackle shed & some rusty water pumps. He attempts to get water out because he was runing out but all he could get was muck, then what he described as “water feeling two-hundred degrees, it had the flavor of battery acid. Further down the road was a sign that said rough road ahead, adhere to the posted speed limit of 55, he was going 12 mph. Even worse he found an abandoned juice factory on the way, at that point he was out of water.	2	2		2																						118	5	131	6	0	0	4.203389830508475	23.6	32	17	3	6	2	13	65	10.2	6.97	8.31	15	8.9	9.7	12.75	6.7	148
4434	6831	3	After reading “Do not Exceed Posted Limit” I have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who tell him a bad shortcut. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. “that mood” was replaced by short, moving hills.” The cyclist could not er nuertecy tried everything, not showing how long he have to continue going up and down. There at one point he says, “@CAPS1 can feel so cruel.” There, he is upset because a road sign come up through acid tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also. When you take a short cut in life, there are always consciences as you decide to drop out of high school is go on how with your journal, where is always the posibility of is not working, and where you cry with no diploma ?? and he gets a job	3	3		3																						205	10	223	10	0	2	4.195121951219512	20.5	37	36	12	15	6	27	116	13.0	7.15	8.49	24	11.1	13.21	14.5	10.0	264
4440	6837	3	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become deyhdrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water.	1	1		1																						104	7	116	3	0	0	4.413461538461538	14.857142857142858	26	14	4	6	3	11	63	6.8	7.13	6.5	12	7.9	8.27	7.2857142857142865	9.2	152

As the narrator sas"" I was travelling throuhg the high deserts of california in June"" which is extremely not in california in June. The deserts hot weather made him eimited on water supply, and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere, no buildings around makes him lose all hope for making it through. There were snakes in the desert which endagered him, and the bumpy road made it harder for him to hold on and get to somewhere.

4449	6846	3	Many features of the cyclist’s surroundings effect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor cycles, or even buildings. It’s like he’s on the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won’t hit any thing. The fact that he’s alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident.	1	1		1																						71	6	82	5	0	0	4.52112676056338	11.833333333333334	19	9	6	6	3	15	38	5.8	7.18	8.22	11	4.4	7.54	5.75	8.3	92
4450	6847	3	To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would about @NUM1° outside and sunny. You can’t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move in the snow. You can’t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could getin a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you be able to ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride.	1	1		1																						117	6	126	2	0	0	3.8547008547008548	19.5	21	16	12	5	5	10	73	6.5	4.64	5.82	2	6.2	7.8	10.2	6.4	136

This quote “about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first “town”. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one time”. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone.	2	2		2																						108	4	114	1	0	0	4.046296296296297	27.0	23	14	8	2	3	10	71	11.1	6.1	7.61	11	9.1	12.28	13.75	9.5	132
4452	6849	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park, thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town. The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store. If it hadn’t been so hot, if the “towns” along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadn’t been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the affore mentioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																						184	10	201	7	0	0	4.586956521739131	18.4	50	26	13	12	3	21	93	9.4	8.76	8.24	32	8.1	9.53	8.666666666666666	9.4	259
4454	6851	3	The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one. He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long  in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the author’s terrain. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with.

4458	6855	3	The features of the setting put an affect on the cyclist. The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds, and a ridiculously large snake. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play.	2	2		2																						78	4	86	4	0	0	4.576923076923077	19.5	19	10	6	2	2	8	46	9.9	8.65	7.03	10	7.4	10.88	11.75	11.2	104
4459	6856	3	One main feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the heat of the day. If you ride a bike in the heat of the day, you are going to use up a lot of water. Another factor is the limited supply of water. The final factor is the wrong directions from the aged men. Aged people aren’t always wrong but their info. Can be out of date.	1	1		1																						69	6	76	1	0	0	3.9130434782608696	11.5	19	5	7	1	1	7	38	2.7	3.63	7.18	9	4.2	5.76	5.25	7.2	89

The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. He described this with sentences like “Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water. The author was getting neat stroke being passed by @LOCATION2  desert snakes and tumbleweeds.

4469	6866	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the “high deserts of California”, making a hint that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he must’ve been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the sun beating down on him. Second, he began to ride through hills, and as common sense would be used, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle especially up hill, and it wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water must’ve tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water. As you can tell, the difference in setting plays it’s crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply.	2	2		2																						133	5	150	11	0	0	4.661654135338346	26.6	31	18	10	7	7	20	71	13.8	9.29	8.4	22	11.3	12.75	14.25	10.8	186

For example, ""About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town."" good thing that he is taking water or who knows if he would of survived or not. I think the biggest mistake was that he asked probaly someone that had not ever been on the road for directions. When he asked the person he ended up at a sign that said Rough road Ahead: Do not exceed, that was the moment I felt sorry for him, and that was probaly the effective feature that has happen to him."	2	2		2																						108	5	119	3	0	0	4.166666666666667	21.6	19	15	6	5	3	10	67	11.7	6.56	7.46	13	10.3	12.28	13.25	8.8	138
4482	6879	3	In the story, the rider faced several meloncholy sites. For examples the “ghost town” that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for futher directions or somewhere to freshen up. Futher on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obsticle that he had to go over. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back. He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him.	3	2		3																						122	7	130	1	0	0	4.0	17.428571428571427	20	21	7	8	3	12	83	6.1	5.22	6.44	10	6.5	9.58	8.666666666666666	10.3	157
4490	6887	3	I think the features of the settings affect the cyclist because the knowledge of the cyclist is limited example, “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office”, meaning now its time for the older people to relax and watch of younger people.	1	1		1																						48	1	53	2	0	0	4.854166666666667	48.0	15	7	3	1	1	5	24	25.4	11.27	11.61	12	19.6	20.87	26.0	0.0	68
4491	6888	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,” That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.” This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						193	10	209	6	0	0	4.221649484536083	19.4	39	28	13	6	7	18	116	10.6	7.09	7.45	22	9.1	11.09	13.0	9.5	252
4508	6905	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. It does because the road is not in good condition and he has to travel a long distance with the bad weather. This affects him because he might get dehydrated. In conclusion there are many things in the setting that affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																						53	4	57	0	0	0	4.490566037735849	13.25	12	8	4	0	1	4	33	6.3	7.47	7.57	10	6.1	8.34	6.625	8.8	74

I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June”. The cyclist is saying that since it is so  hot where he is he has to take regular drinks of water so he stays highdrated throughout is trip.

4531	6929	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road ahead; Do not Exceed the speed limit” affected the narrator in many ways. The first thing that affected his ride was the heat. at first he didnt really notice but then it began to slow him down. Then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride, the roads went from flat sheet to short, rolling hills.” The road change and the heat made him say “I could drop from heatstroke.” Then because of the old towns he went through he was unable to get water. The water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality.	2	2		2																						113	8	122	2	0	0	4.150442477876106	14.125	27	15	9	10	3	13	64	12.2	6.56	7.42	11	9.6	12.38	13.5	9.5	140
4533	6931	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist’s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.	2	3		3																						161	11	177	5	0	0	4.6521739130434785	14.636363636363637	37	19	17	12	3	24	88	8.5	8.81	7.87	26	7.2	8.18	6.0	8.5	230

Then he didn’t ask someone elses apirean on where to go and how to get there. His worsed mistake tough was not trusting the map he had with him the howl time.

4543	6941	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didn’t bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer way. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling. Moreover, it was a June day and in June the days are hot with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated. This is how the setting affected the cyclist	2	2		2																						130	6	139	4	0	0	4.323076923076923	21.666666666666668	22	21	7	9	4	10	82	9.8	7.37	7.51	15	9.4	11.14	12.0	11.2	179
4551	6949	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a “run-down” rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.	3	3		3																						135	9	151	5	0	0	4.311111111111111	15.0	34	19	13	5	5	15	78	6.4	6.43	6.49	13	5.6	7.78	6.714285714285714	8.5	178

4566	6964	3	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One reason was that he was in the desert. Like in the quote “through high deserts of California. This means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke. Then he couldn’t even get any water. Like on the quote “of the rusted water pump.” it was describing how old it was then the cyclist got some out but it tasted like old battery acid.

4591	6989	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling”, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a “modernized” town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."	3	2		3																						151	8	173	11	0	0	4.503311258278146	18.875	36	26	11	5	7	26	80	9.2	8.01	8.23	23	7.1	9.94	11.8	10.1	199
4598	6996	3	The features of the setting is that it is hot and dry. The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets very hot and he drinks almost all of his water and he only has about @NUM1 sips left when he gets to the other town. It also effects him because he had an advantage. The advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up. So then he had a time to get cool. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind. Also when the cyclist was thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth.	2	2		2																						117	7	124	0	0	0	3.7948717948717947	16.714285714285715	20	16	8	8	3	8	80	4.8	4.06	5.95	6	5.1	7.02	7.833333333333334	6.9	143
4605	7003	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include:- the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first “town” he found he described as a “ghost town” It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly and [he] was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road [being] replaced by short, rolling hills wasn’t helping either.

4620	7018	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes “that road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road. The speed limit is also affect the cyclist. When the the speed limit sign is appear, the character feels “life can feel so cruel” (kurmaskie @NUM1).

4624	7022	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist is many different ways. One way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out. Since the cyclist is getting worn out he needs to drink more and more water. Now that he’s drinking more water his running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it. Then when he starts to use less water to conserve it until he gets to the next town he starts to become dehydrated and more tired and he starts to feel weak. Also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired. It also starts to get hotter and he gets thirsty more often.

After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he’s going to die.

4631	7029	3	At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey, is just beginning. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles “battery acid.” The terrain begins to feel like more of a hill, which makes the struggle even worse. The cyclist is drinking water more now, and is becoming tired. He comesto a rough road and says, “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative affects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride, a snake blocks his path and he becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of water in the restroom.

Also, at the first town the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause with water tastd like “battery acid”. Even after that were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit. The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along ride. The pebbles that he found helps him out.

He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and it’s wrong. The man figure that out halfway through the story. He also said that “the old man hasn’t been off his porch since Carter was in office,” so he needs to get his directions up to date.

Joe writes, “Things began well enough… flat roads…” This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a “smile on the face.” (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next “town”. Finally, when the author reaches “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp” he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, “know The best way to get There? “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude.	2	2		2																						172	13	196	8	1	1	4.565714285714286	13.461538461538462	44	35	15	8	5	36	78	8.3	8.47	8.56	25	5.8	7.6	6.714285714285714	8.3	227

However, there were many problems with this idea. First of all, blimps themselves were not very sturdy. Strong winds could easily blow dirigibles trying to dock into the spires of other buildings. Dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than Helium. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable. The smallest the sparking could set the whole blimp ablaze. The docking system its self was also a problem. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side. One concern was that a way could fall off and fall into the densely populated city below. This could've proved very disastrous!	3	3		3																						130	12	147	4	1	0	4.8	10.833333333333334	36	15	13	11	2	15	72	6.6	8.62	8.3	24	5.1	6.78	5.0	8.8	185

One obstacle they had to face was the steel work of the building. The pressure of the wind and the dirigibles load had cost the company @MONEY1. Secondly, they had to design a few special floors for the passengers of the dirigibles. One floor would be for baggage and suitcases while a special observation deck was set up for passengers to exit or enter the ship. Lastly, the building would now be 102 floors and would need to be very durable so special materials were needed to be brought in and used to create the building. All in all, the Empire State Building engineers had to overcome many obstacles when constructing the 1,250 ft. building.	1	1		1																						141	7	155	6	0	0	4.702127659574468	20.142857142857142	45	19	8	7	5	12	75	10.8	9.34	8.22	26	9.9	10.88	10.333333333333334	11.8	205

The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose due to many reasons and many obstacles. One of those many reason was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Furthermore the biggest obstacle to the sucessful use of morning mast was nature itself. Due to the reason that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe. The other obstacles was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building for the entire idea was dropped.

Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even ""swivel around the mooring mast."" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below.

The idea failed parially due to the impracticality of docking a @DATE2 foot balloon filled with flamable gas to a city building. The mere size of this glimpse was astounding and this created many problems. Firstly The wind atop a skyscrapper is great and inconsitent. It is extremely difficult to dock to a building a seen when the Los Angeles tried to dock in @DATE1. The balloon was unable to dock due to potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city. The blimps were also kept afloat by Hydrogen which due to its chemical nature is extremly flamable. Blimps had exploded in the past such as the Hindenburg. Engineers knew that if a similar accident occurred at the Empire state Building, substantial damage would have been done to the city and building itself.

8965	14915	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One of which being that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used Hydrogen to float, making them very flammable and unsafe. If a blimp were to be damaged over New York, many people could be hurt. Also, nature itself made docking extremely difficult. Winds made the blimps very unstable. If one were tied to the mast, winds could wrap the line around the mast. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas.

The load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit pressure and stress onto the buildings foundation. This was a high safety concern, and pivotal to the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the empire state building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast.

This would cause any dirigible attempting to dock swing around and below in the wind, which poses many safty risks for passengers going on and off the zepplen. The dirigible could also puncture its frame on nearby buildings while attempting to dock, which also causes safty risks for people on the building and on the ground.

9049	14999	6	In order for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles (blimps), many obstacles had to be overcome by the architects. One of those obstacles was the Empire State Building's frame. If a thousand-foot dirigible was moored on top of the building with just a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the foundation of the building due to the dirigibles load and wind pressure. Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. Because dirigibles in the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding, and threatening the dense population of downtown New York City. Possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. On top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below.

One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. So Al Smith thought putting a mooring mast at the top of the building, would allow dirigibles to dock there several hours. It would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off. Another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored. It would be held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. Third obstacle would be using hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen it is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																						176	10	192	6	0	0	4.670454545454546	17.6	50	24	8	8	6	14	101	9.4	8.99	7.92	28	7.8	9.54	10.166666666666666	11.4	253

Without being weighted down the dirigibles would swivel around.	3	3		3																						140	9	156	3	0	0	5.0928571428571425	15.555555555555555	39	21	8	5	4	14	82	10.3	11.25	8.36	26	8.2	9.38	7.571428571428571	10.5	206

Which was forty-six feet taller, than the Empire State. Which led to Smith making the State Building reach the height of 1,250 feet. This leads to another obstacle, he wanted to add a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. This didn't work due to lack of landing space. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would cause stress to the buildings frame.In conclusion I just explained the obstacles of the Empire State Building.	1	1		1																						108	8	126	4	0	0	4.836363636363636	13.75	40	16	4	1	0	13	55	10.8	10.21	8.48	15	8.0	9.05	8.666666666666666	10.1	149

How to dock a dirigible to the side of a building was one of the biggest concerns, but the amount of stress this would cause was an even bigger worry.  But the greatest obsticle to this project was the wind, nature itself.  The fear was that the wind would blow the dirigible into a neighboring building, and tethering the dirigible was not an option for safety reasons.  Due to the architect's inability to overcome these obsticles the Empire State Building was never used for it's original purpose.	2	2		2																						117	5	133	5	0	0	4.710743801652892	24.2	37	11	7	2	4	14	69	59.9	11.4	12.68	21	47.7	50.56	12.0	0.0	178

They also had to have wenches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. The architects also needed to install housed elevators and stairs bring passengers down to the base floor and back up. After the renovations were done to be empire state building it had 102 floors. After the building was done the owners found out that they could not let dirigibles on to the building.

This creates safety hazards not only passengers and employee's of the dirigible but also the densely populated area below, that is downtown New York."	4	3		4																						227	10	254	8	0	0	4.788546255506608	22.7	63	28	18	16	7	20	123	12.5	10.1	7.89	36	11.0	12.25	13.0	13.0	342

9285	15235	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building is located in the densely populated New York City. Therefore, if the dirigible dangled high in the air above those people, it would surely be unsafe In addition to the safety aspect, one of the greatest obstacles was nature. The violent winds on top of the building are always shifting due to the air currents, therefore, it would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, thus making it illegal for dirigibles to ever fly up to the building.	3	1		2																						114	6	126	7	0	0	4.798245614035087	19.0	32	13	7	12	0	11	60	12.6	10.22	8.92	25	11.0	12.28	12.0	12.0	172

First obstacle discovered was ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (Lüsted). This was an issue because hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch on fire in New York, thousands of people would be hurt/killed. The greatest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind changed constantly and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to danger on the streets. The dirigible would be dangling over the pedastrians (Lüsted). One other reason was a legal reason. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building Two tried and neither of them were successful. The constructors of the mooring mast were oblivious to these issues at the beginning, than realized them after. The Empire State Building could not be used to land dirigible due to the fact that non-U.S dirigibles used Hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach."	4	3		4																						216	11	245	8	0	0	4.861111111111111	19.636363636363637	53	28	20	14	4	22	125	11.3	10.15	7.83	35	9.8	11.17	10.833333333333334	12.7	319
9296	15246	6	In the Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. To dock, a moor mast was necessary. One could not simply Place one on the empire state building because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add stress, which would force more modifications to the frame costing upwards of sixty thousand dollars. The mooring mast was not completed mainly because of safety. After the combustion of the Hindenburg, owners of the Empire State Building realized a disaster it would cause if it hapened in New York. Nature was also an obstacle, with constantly changing violent air currents threatening to move the dirigible, which could not be anchored down as it could be in a field. It was a risk not worth taking. Lastly, a law passed earlier prevented dirigibles from even approaching buildings on such elevation over urban areas. These were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	4		4																						187	10	207	9	0	0	4.983957219251337	18.7	53	27	9	10	1	20	95	11.4	10.97	8.62	39	9.4	12.19	10.166666666666666	12.3	286
9298	15248	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirt dribbles to dock there was, if they dropped the mooring mast on the top of the building they would have strengthened the frame because of the wind pressure, and pressure from the single cable. Also most dirigibles from out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. Another problem was that New York is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building on to citizens down below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if that could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around. They also suggest using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger. The last obstacle faced with the fact that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas.	3	3		3																						185	8	196	3	0	0	4.616216216216216	23.125	46	23	12	11	3	11	111	11.9	9.46	8.11	30	9.9	11.83	19.333333333333332	11.2	255
9299	15249	6	When the builders of the @ORGANIZATION2 took on the difficult task of building a mooring mast at the top of the structure for dirigibles to dock at, they faced various obstacles that made it difficult for them to carry out their plan. One of the first obstacles they were faced with was the fact that they couldn't just slap a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The huge dirigible that would be held by one cable tether would add an immense amount of stress to the building's frame and fandation. The builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building. The main problem the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure were the safety issues. Dirigibles (aside from the @LOCATION1) mostly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and increases the risk of fire. Since the blimps would be above thousands of pedestrians of the city, the risk of a blimp catching fire was much too high. On top of that, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always Shifting due to the violent air currents, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. Although Al Smith had a great vision for docking blimps at the top of his building, the reality was that it was unrealistic, and the bulders were faced with too many obstacles for it to work.	3	3		3																						239	10	260	6	0	0	4.640167364016737	23.9	68	26	16	10	3	20	141	12.4	9.35	8.13	38	10.3	12.57	15.25	12.0	331

9317	15267	6	The plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building encountered problems from its introduction until its conclusion. The first problem was the original design of the building. The original design did not include a dirigible docking station. When plans for the station were introduced, the building was not strong enough to carry the heavy load of a spire and a dirigible. To adjust, an additional @MONEY1 were spent in order to ensure the building would be structurally sound during a dirigible docking. The next problem became imminent after the Hindenburg's fire: any hydrogen-filled dirigible that caught fire at the Empire State Building which cause significant damage. Moreover, because many dirigibles used hydrogen, the safety risk was significant. Wind proved to be another obstacle. The force of a dirigible being blown around by heavy winds could prove to be too much for the structure of the building. Moreover, because any dirigible docking at the building would be one thousand feet off the ground, there was no way to anchor the dirigibles. The fact that many tall spires lined the @LOCATION1 skyline presented an imminent danger to any dirigible trying to dock. Finally, one of the most significant problems of building a dirigible docking station was the fact that law prohibited low flying aircraft in urban areas.	4	4		4																						218	12	241	7	0	0	5.174311926605505	18.166666666666668	61	26	27	8	1	22	111	12.0	11.77	7.8	35	10.4	10.4	11.0	12.6	353

The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

The architects thought that heavy weights could be put onto the ends of the blimps, but they then realized that that would not be safe for pedestrians walking below Also, the building had to be a ceetain number of feet high, in order for the airship height rule to be eliminated. If it was not an something exploded, the heavily populated city of New York would be in grave danger.

9371	15321	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public.	4	4		4																						241	11	260	7	0	0	4.626556016597511	21.90909090909091	68	29	12	9	8	18	136	11.3	9.11	7.8	29	8.3	10.59	11.2	10.0	316

9376	15326	6	The builders of the empire state building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. Mainly the idea was just not practicle. Having an up to @NUM1 foot blimp is full of flamable nitrogen hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. One accident and tons of lives would be at stake. Especially after the German blimp the Hindenburg crashed, workers knew, had that happened in New York their death tolls would be huge.Along with the extreme perels that the builders knew would be at stake, mother nature would also not make it easy for dirigible to dock at the empire state building. The winds atop the building were constantly shifting. The air currents were too violent and posed to many threats for danger. Even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge. Lead tools can be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging above tons of people this would not be a safe idea.Overall the idea of having a dirigible connected to the empire state building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost.	3	3		3																						198	11	216	5	0	0	4.51	18.181818181818183	55	23	16	10	4	17	106	11.0	8.65	8.4	29	8.3	11.43	12.0	10.5	267

First, the builders had to change the structure of the tower to make it strong enough to support the weight of the dirigible swaying in the wind. Lüsted writes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load... Would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" When the mast was finally built, the builders faced the problem of having the dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" If one ever fell, hundreds of people will be killed. Finally, there was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" By docking at the Empire State Building, the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Although it was a good idea, ""The Mooring Mast"" shows that it would not be possible for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																						192	11	225	9	0	0	4.864583333333333	17.454545454545453	59	26	8	11	0	27	98	9.5	9.51	7.97	32	7.2	8.48	7.2857142857142865	9.9	272
9411	15361	6	The-builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the biggest concern at each stage. The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems in docking these aircraft. If a blimp was to explode in downtown New York, it could be a disaster. Another obstacle that would be faced is nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were coming around. These would make for docking the airships to be illegal. The idea for making the Empire State Building a mooring post was an engineering feat but the actual usage of it was not practical.	3	3		3																						132	10	146	2	0	0	4.878787878787879	13.2	40	15	10	5	1	13	69	8.2	9.56	9.2	32	7.3	9.83	6.75	10.4	196

That purpose would be to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast. This seemed like a good idea, taking a mode of transportation very popular and new and allowing it to run in New York City. Then their were problems, in the beginning the architects knew that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". So, with the time thay had, they assumed that they fixed the problem, but when it was finished the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fufil it's purpose..."" Most of the problems didn't arise from the building but the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big crowded city, such as the highly flamable hydrogen that fills most dirigibles or the closeness of the other buildings to the blimps could cause them to burn. Overall the idea was good in theory, but could never be excuted. Only two dirigibles ever docked their and it has never been used since"	3	3		3																						197	8	222	10	0	0	4.700507614213198	24.625	52	27	15	9	7	21	110	13.0	9.52	8.38	30	10.5	12.28	12.0	11.7	280
9524	15474	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigibles, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the tops of the building it would add stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress. The cost of the modifications was over sixty thousand dollars. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. This was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building was unsafe. This first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the United States, used hydrogen into helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast. All these challenges along with an existing law they did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there.	4	4		4																						228	10	244	5	0	0	4.780701754385965	22.8	59	29	14	8	3	13	131	12.5	10.33	7.75	32	9.8	11.75	8.666666666666666	11.8	326

9536	15486	6	When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, big problems became apparent to them that caused complications in docking dirigibles. One factor was that by law, dirigibles couldn't be that low above the city, as they could accidently  crash into a building and fall onto the crowds below. Another factor was the air currents around the tall buildings, especially the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the winds would violently rock it, and could crash against the building and fall to the streets below. A recent factor arose when the Hindenburg dirigible burst into flames from the hydrogen in it when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. Nobody wanted to risk that happening over New York City, either. So because of flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and by law, the builders had complications when building the mooring mast to allow dirigibles to land there.	3	4		4																						170	7	190	12	0	0	4.830409356725146	24.428571428571427	52	18	9	10	4	16	90	13.6	10.51	8.19	23	11.6	12.31	14.75	12.0	249

9539	15489	6	"@ORGANIZATION2's article The Mooring Mast"", explains the many problems with using the peak of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles. First of all, dirigibles that travelled internationally were filled with Hydrogen, a very flammable gas. Having another Hindenburg-style disaster over New York City would be very dagerous. Also, the winds at the top of the spire are rapidly changing and unpredictable, making an approach dangerous. It would normally be okay for a blimp to land in a windy area, because lead weights could be fastened to ropes holding the blimp down. Without landing on the ground, such as just attaching to the spire, there was no way to weigh down the blimp to stabilize it. Finally, a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas, making a docking at the Empire state illegal. Many practical reasons crushed the dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State."""	3	3		3																						150	8	173	10	0	0	5.053333333333334	18.75	45	21	12	11	1	20	75	11.7	11.14	9.2	32	9.4	11.25	10.333333333333334	11.9	225

9639	15589	6	The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was intentionally built for dirigible docking. Although the problem with allowing that to happen was not questioned at the time of the mast's construction, safety issues were a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen gas, which is extremely flamable. The news of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in flames greatly concerned the owners of the Empire State Building. They imagined how much more worse that would be if a dirigible combusted on the building and in a dense population of Downtown New York. This caused the builders of the Empire State Building to reconsider allowing dirigibles dock at it's mooring mast.	2	2		2																						114	6	124	2	0	0	5.184210526315789	19.0	36	13	9	5	1	10	56	12.5	12.18	9.29	26	10.7	11.46	10.333333333333334	12.2	181

9664	15614	6	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to moor there were, the framing of the building and the height of the building and where passengers would land and dock. The frame of the building was important because if a thousand feet dirigible were to moor at the top of the building, it could add stress to the building's structure and frame and transfer it all down to the building's foundation. Wind pressure and directional change would also push the dirigible according adding more stress *** to the building.The building was at first designed to be @NUM1 floors, but to allow a dirigible to dock there and the load and unload passengers it needed more room and more height The building needed an observation room and a boarding area. When the building was redesigned the building reached to 102 floors and on the 101st floor it was an observation room doubled as a boarding area.The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles for the design of the attempt to allow dirigibles to moor on the roof including adding height to the building. The foremost problem though, was the framing of the building. It needed to be strengthened and in doing so it would allow a dirigible to moor on the top with no issues to the structure of the building.	2	1		2																						227	9	245	4	0	0	4.668122270742358	25.444444444444443	67	29	12	5	13	13	129	19.7	10.28	8.23	28	15.6	16.67	19.666666666666668	12.7	317

9672	15622	6	When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled.	3	3		3																						208	10	227	6	0	0	4.5625	20.8	49	27	17	13	1	19	125	10.4	8.65	7.63	29	9.0	10.82	10.5	11.8	294

These obstacles were very difficult to solve.      In the dirigibles, there are filled with hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flamable if the dirigibles caught on fire. It is also dangerous to be above a very densely populated area because if the dirigible ever failed, it would fall on inocent bystanders.

One of these problems, (that was noticed after building of the Mooring Mast), was how difficult it would be to keep a blimp steady and attached to something without pulling the building over on itself. Another issue was safety and one thing that was unsafe about it was that most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable. One more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably.	2	2		2																						102	4	111	3	0	0	4.833333333333333	25.5	24	10	10	5	2	8	63	14.1	10.57	8.31	16	10.9	12.55	14.25	11.2	144

9923	15873	6	While building the mast for dirigibles to be able to dock their, the architects neglected to see many flaws that were waiting to happen. First off it was against the law to have air craft fly that low to the ground. Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so having that fly above a heavily populated area would not be to safe. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object. In conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen.	3	3		3																						120	5	129	4	0	0	4.566666666666666	24.0	26	18	9	10	1	8	70	12.1	9.06	7.98	19	10.3	12.27	14.5	11.6	169

However this was not the case. There were reasons that were apparent before it was ever builtOne of the greatest obstacles was nature itself The winds at the top of the building were too strong for the dirigible to be safetly secure. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, and trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical. Another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. But two ships did try to land.

Constructed in the 1930s the Empire State Building was originally built to exceed the height of the Chrysler Building; it was going to stand at a whopping 1,250 feet tall. What added to this building's height was its great mooring mast that stood atop the building Dirigibles, very similar to balloons, were gaining popularity in the aviation world. However, there were many issues that held back the progress of this project. Most of these issues were safety problems. One practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was because of an existing law against airships flying too low to urban areas Another reason was the flammibility of these ships. Most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the ship exploded many civilians and passengers would be killed.

New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was wind. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speed. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties.

The next problem was lack of a suitable landing area They decided to put an anchor on the top of the building to secure the dirigibles when docked. The anchor was a winch at the top of the building but the violent winds at the top of the building would not allow the pilot of the dirigible to get close enough to the ancor because of fear that the dirigible might be speard by a nearby building.

They were faced with many architectural, @CAPS1 and nature based dilemmas. When designing the mast, they realized they could not just place the mast on top. The wind pressure mixed with all the stress of the dirigible being held by one cable would send the stress throughout the building, and even down to the foundation.

Initially, the Empire State Building was built only for inside use, so the mast would add stress to the buildings frame and possibly damage it. Secondly, the Empire State Building was built in a very densely populated area so if any malfunctions were to occur such as the Hindenburg in 1937, many people could be killed down below. Another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and they were very strong as well so any dirigible mounting on the building was threatened by swiveling and flying off when landing. The masters in the architectural era had made a true mistake when they planned the construction of the Empire State Building, and it never could have reached its potential for many obvious reasons.	3	3		3																						164	6	178	8	0	0	4.945121951219512	27.333333333333332	42	21	11	15	4	14	89	15.5	11.2	8.84	31	12.8	14.58	15.5	13.0	241

10291	16241	6	In the beginning the use of dirigibles seemed like a good idea. They could be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed it showed signs of problems. The engineers planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of stress to the building's frame. They next found that safety was an issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was flamable. Also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street. With out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel in the air with a possibility of puncturing its shell. Finally there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. There was high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end they had more cons then pros.	3	3		3																						180	12	195	2	0	0	4.605555555555555	15.0	46	24	12	10	3	14	104	7.8	8.34	7.8	27	6.8	8.44	7.7142857142857135	10.3	250

There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream.Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas.

These three main obstacles where the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircrafts. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it'd spin around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast.

Most of the obstacles should have been realized before the mast was even built.One of the obvious obstacles was the constant change in wind. The back of the blimp would not be tied down therefore swinging around in the sky. Another, obstacle would be the design of the mast. This was important because if designed wrong the mast would put stress on the building and could cause a lot of damage. Their was also a law about airships flying too low in urban areas, New York being an urban area. One of the most dangerous reasons was that some blimps were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable.Al Smith and his architects should have realized and discussed these issues before constructing an unusable structure.

10545	16495	6	In this excerpt The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstical was to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building, but they overcame that with the desion to add a top or a hat to the building. They then had to accomidate with the new situation that new modifications had to be done so that the dirigible would not add stress to the buildings frame, since the steel frame of the building could not with stand the load and wind pressure that would transmitt nearly @NUM1 feet below. The biggest obstacles that led to the fate of the mast was the fact of, since most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was very flammable, and they could not have any accidents taking place above downtown New York. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle though because, of the constant shifing winds. The dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but with them dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not safe or practical. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

According to Lüsted, this would have caused the back of the dirigibles to ""swivel around the mooring mast,"" which would not have been ""practical nor safe."" @CAPS2, there were legal issues the builders faced. There was a law at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas.

10607	16557	6	The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State went through many obstacles. They would first have to modify and strengthened the buildings frame to accommodate this new situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State building would never work. The greatest reason was saftey. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930's the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes.	3	3		3																						208	12	228	3	0	0	5.038461538461538	17.333333333333332	58	28	15	13	5	17	112	11.0	11.13	8.44	44	8.9	10.96	10.166666666666666	11.7	320
10617	16567	6	Building just a building alone is a tremendous job for builders, then adding on a docking mast for dirigibles makes it significantly more difficult.
