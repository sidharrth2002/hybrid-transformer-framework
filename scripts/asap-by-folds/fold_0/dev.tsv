5993	9549	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because that paragraph says when she is going to try to take the test and make changes in her changing life. For example she is sad in the story because she failed the test and want to go home. If she passes in the spring she might try to make changes and live here. This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																						73	4	77	0	0	0	4.178082191780822	18.25	15	15	1	2	3	4	45	7.4	6.62	6.49	6	5.7	7.87	8.375	6.0	90

It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return” the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance”. This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again”, because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started."	3	3		3																						220	7	245	15	0	0	4.531818181818182	31.428571428571427	48	36	6	14	12	28	127	15.6	8.95	7.71	25	12.0	14.01	19.0	10.3	283
6003	9559	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has meaning. The author is saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance she too, will get hers. For example, the geese will get to return, the hibiscus will get it's chance to bud and she will get her chance to take her drivers test. I know this because Saeng’s mother starts talking about how great the plant will be in the spring. She even says, “But its strong enough to make it through the cold months”. This indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance. That is why the story ends with that sentence.	2	2		2																						116	6	127	4	0	0	4.396551724137931	19.333333333333332	27	21	4	3	2	13	75	7.6	7.31	7.05	12	5.0	8.02	8.0	7.4	144

6065	9621	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. In the story there are some quotes to support my response “I-I failed the test” Saeng said.” This shows that she was taking a test about gardening. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life of it to them. The paragraph talks about spring, and flowers. The daughter and mother live off of the plants by planting vetagables, and fruits.	0	0		0																						88	6	99	4	0	0	4.795454545454546	14.666666666666666	30	10	1	0	4	12	49	10.0	9.51	7.2	8	6.6	7.49	8.4	7.6	117

And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that happens. She was really sad she failed. “I – I failed the test” She seemed to be embarrassed + sad.

6088	9644	4	There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique. Because most stories aren’t about nature.

6117	9674	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese because it shows how Saeng, like the geese, will adopt to her new environment. It shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do. She will take the test again and will not give up. The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, “… she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes”[No]. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and that she does not like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, “…she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac”[Ho]. This proves how even though she @MONTH1 not like things at times, Saeng is willing to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, “…she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now “[@NUM1].Saeng is getting more and more used to her surrounding and is adopting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese.	3	3		3																						230	10	258	13	0	0	4.261802575107296	23.3	42	35	14	12	6	28	147	10.4	7.2	7.04	16	7.5	10.42	8.0	9.1	282
6120	9677	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for a reason. The hibiscus reminds her of Vietnam. The geese remind her of her home now. These two things make her strong. Therefore, she will take the test when they return. She thinks she can pass the test when the flower and the geese are in her life.	1	1		1																						57	6	64	1	0	0	4.368421052631579	9.5	14	8	1	2	1	7	36	3.9	5.59	6.32	6	2.3	4.5	3.916666666666667	5.5	70

6129	9686	4	The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One reason is to show Saeng is not going to give up and keep trying to pass her test.

6131	9688	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng feels like that will be the right time to take over her driving test over and when the hibiscus is budding.

The girl says allot about the geese in the story, so we know from that she likes animals.	1	1		1																						60	3	64	1	0	0	4.316666666666666	20.0	14	10	0	3	2	4	36	8.9	7.25	7.52	5	6.4	8.67	10.666666666666666	7.8	73
6188	9745	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph (when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again) because it explains what she is going to do when winter is over. Also to keep the readers guessing on what’s going to happen, to Saeng and her mother. Another reason is to have a new story when winter is over.	1	1		1																						81	3	91	5	0	0	4.382716049382716	27.0	16	14	2	7	3	11	51	12.7	7.72	7.31	8	10.3	11.29	14.166666666666666	7.8	106
6189	9746	4	I know the reason why the author concludes the story the way he dose and  it is a good reason . It says that since she failed this year next year when it is time to ready up the garden she will tell again . That is a good moral because you have to keep trying and trying to succeed   because even if you fail you are not losing any  progress. It is like what @PERSON1 had happen to him even though it took him @DATE1 tries to successfully  make the light bulb he simply said “ I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb . So I do agree with this author and how he ended the story.	1	1		1																						123	5	129	0	0	0	3.6850393700787403	25.4	18	24	6	7	3	8	74	8.8	5.0	7.06	8	7.9	9.93	12.75	5.7	149
6198	9755	4	Saeng promises herself that  “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agan.” The hibiscus is meta phorica to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of her homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, “that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable.	1	1		1																						241	12	263	10	0	0	4.508196721311475	20.333333333333332	51	35	14	16	10	27	136	12.1	8.94	7.66	29	10.3	11.6	8.666666666666666	10.8	327

The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again.

Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she can’t be sad forever. She must be determined in order to pass the test.

She went to the greenhouse & spent @MONEY1 on a hibiscus plant that reminded her of her home. It the same time the hibiscus plant reminded her that her new home is another new beginning.

6258	9815	4	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more.

6269	9826	4	The author concludes the story with paragraph because it shows Saeng’s sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she dissappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her mom’s gardening, she says, “Here, let me help, mother,” because her mom’s frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, “Saeng didn’t dare look her mother in the eye,” which shows Saeng’s concern for her mother’s reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, “It’s a beautiful plant, I’m glad you got it,” which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saeng’s sympathy to better   herself is shown in the story’s conclusion.	1	1		1																						139	6	160	17	0	0	4.714285714285714	23.333333333333332	32	27	10	3	2	32	67	12.4	9.52	7.85	13	10.0	11.29	11.2	10.5	190
6292	9849	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.” She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself so she made a vowe to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her.	1	1		1																						86	4	94	5	0	0	4.395348837209302	21.5	16	16	1	7	4	12	54	13.6	8.19	7.81	10	10.9	13.81	16.0	10.5	112
6295	9852	4	The author decides to end the story with the paragraph to show many things. First of all, the author uses the ending paragraph to show optimism. The whole story had been sad but the ending shows some hope. In the beginning it says, “ @CAPS1  of loss so deep… “(@NUM1) and at the end it says, “ I will take that test again.” (@NUM2) shows how her  attitude   changes from cynical to hopeful. Another reason why the story is ended with that paragraph is to show how Saeng was accepting. When the story says that the geese were  , “ almost familiar to her now.”(@NUM2) demonstrates that even though Saeng is sad to leave her home, she is adapting quite well. Therefore, the author ends the story with an inspiring paragraph to show change for the better.	2	2		2																						137	7	158	6	0	0	4.338028169014085	20.285714285714285	34	21	9	7	2	21	77	9.4	7.66	7.15	14	7.3	9.52	8.333333333333334	9.2	183
6296	9853	4	"The author is concluding the story with that parapraph stating when spring and @DATE2 comes again then she will take the test again.

6298	9855	4	I say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy. She was still going to take it again, she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day from failing her driver’s test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower so she went to a florist to see if she can buy it. When she does purchase it she goes home and gives it to her mom and they plant it. So maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck I think.	1	2		2																						107	6	113	1	0	0	3.8878504672897196	17.833333333333332	15	21	6	9	4	7	69	7.6	4.93	6.76	9	6.9	10.43	11.0	8.8	127
6303	9860	4	The author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an end. Wit  this saeng tell @LOCATION1 that all the snow is gone she will take the test again. If one read   now between the lives it   says more than just this. She really likes the hibiscus and when the hibiscus goes back to life in the spring, she will have new energy to take the test again. From her experience with the hibiscus we can see that this plant really influent her. Because this  plant reminds  her so much of her old home.  Also we can see that everything and everybody should get a second chance. In her case it is the test she wants to take again. Also in the spring she lives a couple month in the @LOCATION1 and she will adjust herself to this new situation. At the moment she is just homesick, even if her home is the @LOCATION1 now.

6306	9863	4	The last paragraph means only one thing. That one thing is to be like a Hibiscus @CAPS1 to take the test again of life. See will come back in the spring just like the Hibiscus will.

6317	9874	4	The author concludes the story like that to show emphasis.Saeng vowed that so that it will teach her everything lives with hope & adaptation. She means that when everything returns and proves they survive, she will too. She will take that drivers test then. The author also wants to prove that people need to have faith in theirselves. You just need to get used to their surroundings.

6336	9893	4	By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story “winter Hibiscus,“ the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of seang at her struggle to live in another country & her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating statement on the test saying “ I will take that test again,” the author gives us that understanding that Saeng has not given up & lets the reader know she will stand & live strong.	2	2		2																						115	4	120	3	0	0	4.356521739130435	28.75	28	19	6	4	3	11	60	18.3	8.72	8.02	13	15.5	17.42	19.666666666666668	13.0	160

It said the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind.” This shows that the plant was not the same because there were also no buds.

6363	9920	4	The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The begining was very negative with Saeng failing her drive’s test and her mother yelling at her. But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will peservere wheras before she was so upset, @CAPS1 when she said, “I-I failed the test.” Then for Saeng to refound from this event, gave the reader hope and thats why the author did this.	2	1		2																						89	4	99	3	0	0	4.51685393258427	22.25	24	15	4	3	4	15	51	11.0	8.54	7.76	8	7.3	10.27	11.875	8.1	111
6370	9927	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her and when it is budding she feels stronger. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say “at home.” When she says “and this hibiscus is budding,” I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a “V” so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again.	3	3		3																						144	6	148	1	0	0	3.9097222222222223	24.0	23	22	7	8	3	10	93	15.0	5.76	7.62	9	12.6	14.68	17.333333333333332	7.2	172

Up until this point Saeng had been lamenting her old country, and not adjusting well to her new one. The Hibiscus inspires her, and lets her know that the new country has many of the same things as her old country. In this last line, she comes to terms with her present situation. ""When the snows melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" is a way of saying shes going to let a little time pass, and by taking her driver’s test again, she will begin her new life."	2	2		2																						117	5	138	9	0	0	4.262711864406779	23.6	27	18	13	2	5	20	65	13.4	7.27	8.06	10	11.2	13.09	14.0	10.1	149
6384	9941	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like this for him/her to have a spin off. I mean to me I think that it mean she is going to try again when spring comes so her and her plant can have a fresh start and I think that is a good way to end it.	1	1		1																						56	3	60	0	0	0	3.5	18.666666666666668	8	10	2	2	2	3	37	9.1	3.03	1.95	1	8.3	11.2	14.0	0.0	61
6389	9946	4	The author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. For example, She writes “she vowed silently to herself.” When you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something. Everything else that she says after that she really means it. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal.	1	1		1																						75	4	82	3	0	0	4.76	18.75	8	15	2	7	0	9	49	10.4	9.69	7.52	9	8.3	10.19	11.375	11.2	106
6392	9949	4	I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.	1	2		2																						77	3	81	0	0	0	4.243589743589744	26.0	10	19	1	3	4	4	52	11.6	7.67	7.17	10	11.0	11.84	14.5	10.5	104
6395	9952	4	The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on.	2	2		2																						181	11	197	5	0	0	4.232044198895028	16.454545454545453	32	31	4	11	9	18	115	6.7	6.44	6.11	13	6.2	7.26	8.0	7.3	228

The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrats this when she says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair."" The hibiscus was something from home that gave her good memorys. The hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better."	2	2		2																						133	7	147	5	0	0	4.62406015037594	19.0	34	21	7	6	4	17	74	9.8	8.88	8.02	16	7.2	10.31	11.4	10.6	176

6410	9967	4	The author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across. It highlights the things important and familiar to saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that she’ll take the test over again once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she sow the plant , “a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng ‘s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. Therefore by mentioning   the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure.	3	3		3																						235	8	255	13	0	0	4.440677966101695	29.5	56	35	18	17	8	27	129	16.3	8.72	7.86	24	12.8	15.24	18.666666666666668	12.0	312

The last paragraph states ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many raesons. These being that Saeng was very upset about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland and the changes she's had to adapt to during this move. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng a hope to continue her jouney even when things get very hard. The winter is this plants time of trouble and sadness, as Saeng's time of trouble and sadness is failing this test and not being at her real home. The end of winter gives both the plant and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope to start over, Saeng will find it easy to get through hardships if she continues to find comfort from her past."	3	3		3																						202	8	229	12	0	0	4.4950495049504955	25.25	60	27	6	9	12	26	116	12.4	8.3	7.55	21	9.6	11.11	10.6	8.5	257

6437	9994	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because when the hibiscus started budding it will give her inspiration to try and past the test again. In order to past the test she wanted to feel like she was home, And to have memories of her home to incourage her to try again.

The winter will change to spring, the snow will melt and vanish, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will also change and mature as well, Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant as the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and she must adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it matured and grew. That is what Saeng must do she must mature and grow in this new country. For example Saeng observed how different the plant looked in the shop window then in did in her home country. She was observing herself and how different she appeared as well. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already and putting it at the end to show that she had grown. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same effect. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change. Saeng is able to do that as well and she made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured just as the things around her have.	3	3		3																						214	10	230	6	0	0	4.228971962616822	21.4	44	35	12	13	8	15	133	9.2	6.79	6.25	13	6.9	9.12	13.75	9.1	262
6448	10005	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorperating the geese, hibiscus and her drivers test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the drivers test again through memories of Vietnam lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not overconsistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story."	1	1		1																						112	6	125	5	0	0	4.875	18.666666666666668	24	19	8	5	2	12	66	10.9	10.33	8.23	19	8.2	9.98	11.8	10.1	162
6449	10006	4	The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to adjust to her new home and that she will not give up. You can tell that she still misses her homeland by her reaction to seeing the hibiscus plant, but also that she is growing accustomed to her new home because of how she recognizes the geese and will make the decision if when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns.	2	1		2																						82	2	85	1	0	0	4.341463414634147	41.0	15	15	3	2	3	4	51	19.5	8.55	9.14	15	15.7	19.33	23.5	0.0	109
6454	10011	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” which was wrote by Minfong Ho. I believe she put it there because it keeps you asking questions. I think because her mom was so disappointed with her that maybe she can change things and make things better.	1	1		1																						43	3	46	0	0	0	4.534883720930233	14.333333333333334	8	8	2	4	1	6	25	7.1	8.05	7.28	5	5.3	7.58	6.833333333333333	7.8	57
6456	10013	4	I think the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph for these reasons. The first reason is to show that the girl won't give up. She was crying in the store and just very depressed. But, she knows that she has to keep going. It shows a sense of determination. Another reason why I think the author made this the last paragraph is this. It showed her getting used to her environment. I think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together. That way she gets hope from both. For example, in the article it says “many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become….. almost familiar to her now. This shows that she is realizing that she is used to the arrangement right now. So she then gets hope from it. Also, I, think the author did that so that it would add a positive effect on the story. That is why I think the author wrote that as the last paragraph.	2	2		2																						184	14	205	5	0	0	4.232432432432432	13.214285714285714	31	32	8	13	4	21	123	5.3	5.96	6.27	16	4.9	7.43	6.0	8.4	237
6464	10021	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because know matter what she said or did she had to git the flower because it remids her of where she used to live and how It was there so she stared to cry and the test was not to buy the flower and not to cry and that in th spring she is going to grow her own flower.

After discovering that she has just failed a test it becomes more apparent that buying the flower is a way to cope with her new situation in @LOCATION1 and feel comforted by her past. The author is able to conclude the story with that satement because it speaks of moving forward without clinging to the past, In the spring saeng  will have a new home and find strength in her past, that is what I feel the final paragraph suggests	3	2		3																						148	3	156	4	0	0	4.373333333333333	50.0	32	23	8	9	4	10	83	24.1	8.95	9.6	25	20.2	22.42	30.0	13.6	205

In addition, the author also conclude the story with this paragraph to show saeng personal thoughts, and how she feels about this test.

She is trying to get over the fact that she is not “at home,” that things and people that use to be ground no longer are. But there are new things that she is becoming used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can alway’s  change. She is trying to put things that make her used further  back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year, because it is always possible to do something if you really wants to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng  really wants to pass her own mind test, so she can further adapt to change, her mother will be proud of her.	3	2		3																						178	6	199	10	0	0	3.9239130434782608	30.666666666666668	31	30	7	12	6	22	119	12.3	6.11	6.8	10	10.2	12.55	10.8	9.3	222

Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that’s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers.

Also, the @DATE2 and spring the plant comes back, which the character saeng will get it back, and visit it.	1	0		1																						112	7	128	9	0	0	4.526785714285714	16.0	29	15	3	6	5	16	70	7.9	7.83	6.97	14	7.2	8.54	7.0	8.8	152
6548	10105	4	I believe that the author left this as the last thing the reader will read, so it will be a message. In the story this girl has now moved to this totally new environment and new culture. The only thing she knew of was a flower that grew wild where she lived. This little vow to herself was a message to not give up. Keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn. So this girl didnt just give up. Her plant was like a representation of a new beginning. When her plant starts over then so will I. Also it can be a representation of her life itself. I say a new begging because in the text, it says,	2	2		2																						131	9	143	3	0	0	3.954198473282443	14.555555555555555	24	18	9	8	3	11	84	3.7	4.22	6.09	7	4.9	6.46	6.714285714285714	7.6	166
6559	10116	4	The paragraph shows that Saeng has a lot of feelings for her plants. She enjoys plants and she loves taking the time to spend with the plants.

6565	10122	4	"The author concludes with this story to show how Saeng is ready to accept her new life. Once the geese and the hibiscus are back she feel like she's at home. When she feels more at home is when she will be ready to take the test again. The text states “run and the geese return"" this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again”. Clearly the geese and hibiscus remind her of home.Once she feels at home, she will feel at ease. Thats why the author concluded with this pasage."	1	2		2																						94	7	105	2	0	0	4.136842105263158	13.571428571428571	21	14	6	5	3	11	57	6.2	6.26	6.27	5	4.6	7.06	7.5	7.8	112
6570	10127	4	"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""It’s-it’s not a real one, ‘Saeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-at’ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on.” One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. “Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.” The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus."	3	3		3																						357	21	406	18	0	0	4.494413407821229	17.047619047619047	76	56	32	30	9	45	204	11.7	8.36	6.85	29	9.0	11.09	13.5	10.2	472
6575	10132	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story the character ” Saeng” is feeling homesick and has not adapted to her new country. She is on her way home from her driver’s test, which she just failed, and on the way she sports a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hishiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort in time of disappoint, connection to her past experiences and ability to overcome obsticales. Saeng has not adjusted to this change in her life and it has affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obsticates in your life but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome it. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and showing the reader that saeng was the hibiscus as her way of overcoming and when she is ready and she has ajusted she will take her driving test again.	3	2		3																						207	8	218	3	0	0	4.51207729468599	25.875	49	26	6	6	10	17	125	12.8	8.88	7.51	27	11.0	13.07	11.6	11.9	286

6586	10143	4	The author end with that paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she has failed this time, more opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times befall her now, good times are still to come. For several reasons, it was a powoful efficient way to end the story.	1	1		1																						54	4	62	4	0	0	4.481481481481482	13.5	10	8	7	5	0	9	32	6.4	7.24	7.23	7	6.2	6.88	6.75	8.8	73
6589	10147	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wants to start planting again. I know this because Saeng life revolves around planting and @CAPS1. Saeng and her mother get there food from what they plant. So all @DATE1 they spend most there time in the garden. growing crops to sell and save. They save for winter and sell to get there equiement to continue whot they do. The part she talking about in the paragraph that say “when they come back” talking about the geese. She loves the geese flying over her head and landing in the yard when she outside on a beauttiful day @CAPS1. when The snow melts she wants to  get back at in the soil on her hands and knee to start planting again. Once the hibiscus start budding everything else starts growing. Saeng live revolves around @DATE1 planting. The author put this paragraph in the story because this is what saeng wants to do more than anything.	1	0		1																						164	12	177	0	0	0	4.545454545454546	13.75	40	35	3	10	6	17	92	8.3	8.35	6.66	13	5.0	7.29	6.285714285714286	6.7	204
6595	10154	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho a girl named Saeng failed her drivers test that day then vowed that she would retake from the spring. She ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life. This archetype being the changing from harsh cold winter to nice warm spring time shows that the trouble her mother and Saeng would get better. As hard trouble winter left than their is calmwarm new beginning spring.

6597	10156	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the statement, “...then I’ll take the test again.” This shows that Saeng is willing to try to adapt to this new place she lives in. That is what refers to when she says “test”. For example, in the story she said, “I-I failed the test,” when her mother asked her what was wrong. She spent so much money on that plant hopping to stay home in her mind. She just couldn’t handle that. She ends with the positive statement because it just sends the message that she looks foward to a bright future in her new home.	1	1		1																						106	7	119	5	0	0	4.311320754716981	15.142857142857142	21	18	8	7	0	18	58	7.7	6.55	7.49	6	5.5	8.21	7.833333333333334	7.2	127
6601	10160	4	The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, “.. in the spring...” it’s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It’s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.	3	3		3																						196	10	219	10	0	0	4.182741116751269	19.7	45	31	17	7	9	27	113	10.6	6.68	6.54	14	9.3	11.02	19.333333333333332	10.4	253
6604	10163	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and there is still hope. It is also to teach the reader to have hope and patience and the knowledge that things take time. Saeng failed the test of not giving into her sorrows and misery of missing her country. She says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows that she is adjusting. So by ending it with this and comparing to the geese, its showing that she is getting stronger. She will take the test again because she wont give up.	2	2		2																						124	7	136	5	0	0	4.491935483870968	17.714285714285715	25	21	5	8	5	14	80	10.1	8.24	7.34	14	7.8	10.22	11.0	8.8	164
6606	10165	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didn’t do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it. The author is showing Saeng’s determination to pass the test and do better next time.	1	1		1																						50	2	54	2	0	0	4.36	25.0	13	8	3	4	2	7	32	11.6	7.84	7.4	4	9.5	10.8	13.0	0.0	64
6607	10166	4	I think the author ends the story with that paragraph because it is linting the plant that stands for many positive things to the character that failed the test that the really wanted to pass. Both the character and the plant show perservirance and I think the author is trying to send a message to the reader to never give up on something you want to accomplish. The plant gives an emblem of perseverance because it survives through the harsh winter. The main character isn’t giving up on the test she wants to pass. The author is giving a message not to give up.	2	2		2																						104	6	109	0	0	0	4.4326923076923075	17.333333333333332	23	20	4	2	3	7	61	9.8	8.12	7.86	11	9.0	9.86	11.4	9.9	141
6610	10169	4	The @ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl named Saeng She is a teenager her family just moved to the United States from Vietnam, Saeng failed her driving test and on the walk home discovers this beautiful plant named Hibiscus she falls in love with the Hibiscus. Saeng's mother has a garden she is always planting things a using plarts a veggies from her garden for dinner. The author conclude a paragraph that says where the Hibiscus plants are budding in the spring Saeng with take the test again. I think Saeng says this because she wants to see the beautiful plants When she passes the test and she thinks seeing th Hibiscus will help her passthe driving test.	1	2		2																						117	4	123	1	0	0	4.6239316239316235	29.25	37	23	2	3	2	11	59	15.0	9.76	8.73	14	12.4	12.75	14.5	11.7	158
6613	10172	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that saeng won’t give up. It is possible to adapt and try to love whats around you. Saeng struggled to get out “I-I failed the test” and couldn’t say “at home” this shows her insecurity and lonleiness for the new world around her and by saying she will try again in the spring gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an expirence today that old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now they have some simalarities and because she will try again in the spring means she has decided to go to give a new place a chance.	2	2		2																						120	5	127	0	0	0	4.208333333333333	24.0	23	27	4	4	7	14	75	13.4	7.5	7.49	10	10.3	14.0	14.0	10.7	147
6617	10176	4	The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girls cofidence in herself. It also gives her enough time to get ready for the next test. Also she knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud.	1	1		1																						41	3	44	0	0	0	4.365853658536586	13.666666666666666	7	7	4	2	0	4	26	6.0	7.01	7.01	3	3.9	5.48	5.833333333333333	3.1	51
6622	10181	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing that the hibiscus inspires her and gives comfort that no person could try and do. For example, after Saeng failed her drivers test, she was disappointed. On her way home she saw a hibiscus and went to a florist shop to try and buy it. Saeng took a peddle from the plant and held it tightly while she closed her eyes. The plant reminded her of her real home in vietnam which she loved. The hibuscus became a form of comfort for Saeng since she had just failed her drivers test, even though the plant was not the same as the one at home. By the author ending the story with Saeng saying she will wait until the hibiscus starts budding to take the test again, it shows that the hibiscus helps her to overcome obstacles in life and it helps her to get through hardships she faces.	2	1		2																						162	7	173	4	0	0	4.308641975308642	23.142857142857142	38	31	4	5	6	12	93	10.4	7.61	7.61	18	8.8	10.72	8.333333333333334	9.6	208
6628	10187	4	"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home, and the old, together in harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which relates to the determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently through the winter. A lot of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages hidden within that final sentence It implies that, though the past @MONTH1 be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can be conquered."	1	2		2																						122	6	139	10	0	0	4.901639344262295	20.333333333333332	26	17	7	6	5	18	70	11.9	10.27	8.16	24	10.0	11.39	10.333333333333334	11.5	180

6646	10205	4	The author, Minfong  Ho, concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The  “budding hibiscus” symbolizes comfort for her. When moving to @LOCATION1 she couldn’t take all her friends a possessions with her, but she could bring memories. The flower reminds her of home, which is comforting after she failed her drivers test. In addition, the “geese returning” symbolizes a new beginning. After being away for so long, the geese returning ushers  in springs a time to start all over after a dreasy  winter. Finally “;,.then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 that one should never give up. Even though ve was hard for her to adapt to a new  country, she made friends a tried @CAPS2 foods, like a Big @CAPS3. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the story with the paragraph to show comfort, new beginnings  a never give up.	3	3		3																						142	10	167	11	0	0	4.655405405405405	14.8	37	21	7	11	1	31	76	9.1	9.22	7.76	21	7.1	8.86	7.857142857142858	10.0	205
6648	10207	4	The author concludes the story with the quote, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again,” to show that she is encouraged by the memories of her homeland. For example, in the story it stated that she realized that many things were similar to things in her homeland. As the seasons went by she discovered the similarities. The spring time reminded saeng of her home, so when at comes she will be motivated to take the test again. In conclusion, the author included the quote to show how she is encouraged by memories of her homeland.	1	2		2																						115	5	126	7	0	0	4.469565217391304	23.0	28	19	3	2	3	12	70	11.1	8.36	7.8	17	9.9	13.37	12.2	12.7	158

The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on her way home had seen an assortment of flowers that were indigenous to her homeland. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost @NUM2) The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged. Her mother states “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough. That’s what @NUM3). Saeng , after hearing this, decides that she could be strong, too, and would try to do her best in school. She would adapt just like the winter hibiscus.	2	2		2																						152	11	173	7	0	0	4.6644736842105265	13.818181818181818	37	22	7	13	4	28	83	10.1	9.05	7.5	19	7.1	9.94	15.25	10.1	203

6702	10261	4	The authors purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return she will have to again take care of the plant. Thats clear because taking a test is a big responsibility therefore taking care of that plant is also a huge task refering  to taking the test again. this is what the purpose of the concluding sentence meant.	1	1		1																						65	3	70	0	0	0	4.393939393939394	22.0	17	9	4	4	1	4	38	15.8	8.83	7.43	7	13.6	14.85	17.75	0.0	88
6707	10266	4	The story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about her “home” where she no longer lived. After she had broke down, bought the plant, and learned to actually accept the fact that she no longer lived in Vietnam and accepting that she had failed her driving test, she realized that she just has to learn to like it. She also learned that her time will come and she will one day be driving. The reason why the auethor concluded the story with this paragraph is because this is the conclusion of the story. this is where one realizes the important things.	1	2		2																						109	5	117	3	0	0	4.458715596330276	21.8	18	21	1	8	4	10	66	13.2	8.48	7.45	12	10.4	13.12	13.75	10.7	141
6708	10267	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a statement that Saeng vowed silently to herself. Saeng says she will take the test again referring to the drivers test. Seeing the geese flying in a “V” and seeing the hibiscus gave Saeng a sense of remembrance to her homeland. Saeng misses he homeland. The author wanted it to seem to the @CAPS1 as if Saeng is starting to feel at home again. The hibiscus is just a symbol to Saeng telling her that It will be @CAPS2.K, and that it’s okay for her to miss Vietnam but also that it’s okay to have a new life, So Saeng, in the spring, will go take her drivers test again with a new attitude and will pass the test.	2	2		2																						132	6	144	6	0	0	4.257575757575758	22.0	36	22	4	7	4	17	72	9.6	6.73	7.84	18	8.3	10.01	8.166666666666666	8.8	169

Saeng “Vowed silently to herself to try again in the spring time.Saeng parchases the hibiscus in remembrance of her homeland, but also to know when it is ready to come back out of the base to try again. The hibiscus does these actions by coming out of its buds and blooming. Ho ends her story in hope of a new beginning.

He doesn't want to just leave us hanging with the girl watching the geese fly away into the distance. The girl felt very bad about failing the test which makes the reader feel sad. To cheer up the reader, he ended the story in this way. Saeng is reminded of home when ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” So, the author ends the story having Saeng have a sense of renewed confidence and the reader feeling happy."	2	2		2																						112	6	123	3	0	0	4.482142857142857	18.666666666666668	25	24	5	4	3	12	59	10.9	8.42	7.57	15	8.5	10.03	11.0	9.4	151
6720	10279	4	The author concludes the story with that because she is determined to succeed in @LOCATION1. She misses her homeland and everything there: gardens, grandparents etc. For example , she walked into the flowershop she smells the flowers like she used to back home. She then smelled a flower that reminded her of her grandmothers “long gray hair, freshly washed …” But by saying that last sentence she said that when the hibiscus budded next winter she will take the test that she failed again.	1	2		2																						84	5	92	3	0	0	4.788235294117647	17.0	16	16	4	5	3	11	47	12.0	10.56	9.04	17	9.0	12.18	12.75	11.7	118
6729	10288	4	This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the atire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flower and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that save her the courage she needed to retake her driver’s test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, “when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...” At first the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story.	0	0		0																						183	8	202	9	0	0	4.461956521739131	23.0	41	23	16	9	10	20	106	12.8	8.36	8.3	26	9.9	12.63	14.5	10.0	238
6731	10290	4	In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again.	2	1		2																						65	5	70	0	0	0	3.6307692307692307	13.0	9	14	4	3	1	5	40	2.2	2.42	5.98	4	3.6	5.2	5.5	3.1	76

The author uses the concludes because when the flower is going to budd and the geese come back she will think that she is back home. Thats why I think the author used the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.	1	1		1																						128	4	139	7	0	0	4.34375	32.0	26	21	3	11	5	10	77	20.3	8.32	7.36	6	15.2	17.71	17.333333333333332	8.8	155

This girl just  failed her driving test she dose not want to take it right away. The blomming of the hibiscus symbolizes her old life at her old home and it is also symbolizing a new start when it bloms. This will give her the confodence to pass her driving test and make he excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return”. This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and fells contible, at home you are contible.

6768	10327	4	The author is expressing hope for the future in her concluding paragraph although just failing her drivers test and adjusting to a new atmoshere Saeng finds comfort in a Hibiscus. “it felt smooth an cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel.” This expresses that the rememberence of “an old friend” was able to lift her spirits after a previous dissappoinment it was obvious Saeng was uncomfortable in her environment, which her mother noticed when she arrived at home. “she paused as she noticed the tear stains on her a daughter’s cheecks and her puffy eyes.” Her daughter was not adjusting to her new atmosphere and even though she had spent a lot of money on a single flower she understood. With all the negative attitude through out the story, once Saeng saw the geese and planted her “winter” hibiscus, she realized what was strange to her before had now become familiar. Saeng finally realizes with a memory of home, her goals can be accomplished and life can be stable somewhere other than home. She illustrates that from failurecomes success.	2	3		3																						190	7	200	4	0	0	4.752631578947368	27.142857142857142	45	25	17	8	5	23	102	24.7	10.93	9.41	32	20.6	23.58	61.0	17.4	277

By concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test. The hibiscus the helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before, through the quit repition of season upon season, almost femiliar to her now.”  In the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season.	3	2		3																						141	6	154	7	0	0	4.52112676056338	23.666666666666668	37	21	7	9	4	18	77	14.1	8.83	7.95	17	11.9	13.55	11.6	11.6	192

I belive she ended that way to let us know that she will be back and when she comes back she will be ready for everything including that test. She left us wondering because when she does come back she is going to want use to Read about what happened when she came back and what happened when she @CAPS1 the test.

6827	10386	4	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal.	3	3		3																						243	8	273	21	0	0	4.565573770491803	30.5	48	40	14	20	10	39	144	20.4	9.42	8.37	22	15.5	17.85	29.0	12.7	309

The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons.

6859	10418	4	The author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. All throughout the story there was depresing nogistalistic tone that made the reader yearn for the past. The author wanted to put on emphisis on being strong even though you @MONTH1 not enjoy where you are at. Also the author wanted to show the strength of the main of the main character Saeng. Even though she has just failed a test in a new, strange world she still wishes to continue pushing foward. This adds more demension the the character and makes her less static and more dynamic. This is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward.	2	2		2																						137	8	146	1	0	0	4.394160583941606	17.125	24	23	13	11	3	14	82	7.8	7.48	7.25	15	6.4	8.59	7.833333333333334	8.5	179
6862	10422	4	“when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author has left her home and moved to another country. She is now in an unfamilar place. Everything that now surrounds her is new and mostly un-known. By ending the story with this quote, it suggest that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home. When she left her home, she did not just leave a building behind. She left her home, people she loved, and an endless list of memories. At times she @MONTH1 have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now “out of the box,” and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and “failed her test.” The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own test of adapting.	3	2		3																						205	12	226	10	0	0	4.195121951219512	17.083333333333332	42	29	13	17	10	26	121	8.6	6.38	6.58	14	6.6	9.37	8.0	8.8	254

She chosee spring because spling is the rebirth of nature and Saeng would like to retake the test with a clear and clean mind.

6864	10424	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces.	2	2		2																						137	8	151	5	0	0	4.810218978102189	17.125	39	25	5	2	7	18	67	11.0	9.98	8.18	21	8.6	10.18	7.142857142857142	10.6	189
6869	10429	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in that way to convey the determination and new found motivation Saeng found by buying the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, finding a plant that reminded her of her home and her grandmother instilled motivation in her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country workout for the better, no matter what. “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky ...” the author included details about the geese to represent moving on. The geese will go, and come back, just like Saeng. She failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. “Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her.” The geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her, in her new home. Concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home. Finding the plant helped her, because it was already familiar to her. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. ‘@CAPS1, Saeng said.’ “After failing her driver’s test, walking into the florist’s shop and finding that plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting. Concluding the story that way showed the reader that she was adapting and learning to deal with a tough situation in a comforting way.	3	3		3																						296	14	324	13	0	0	4.626262626262626	21.214285714285715	61	53	25	18	10	35	155	16.9	9.53	8.04	39	13.8	15.46	29.5	12.7	403
6876	10436	4	This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring.	2	3		3																						191	9	204	6	0	0	4.183246073298429	21.22222222222222	36	33	7	6	7	18	118	10.2	6.8	6.89	17	7.9	10.4	10.6	8.5	238
6881	10441	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. The next time it blooms the girl will be ready for the test and will take it again and will pass. The authour  wants to show that the girl will not give up and will try again to make sure she passes. The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test.	1	2		2																						87	4	92	0	0	0	3.977272727272727	22.0	16	16	4	2	5	6	58	8.3	5.75	6.17	6	7.1	9.18	11.625	8.1	103
6885	10445	4	Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these tequniques a story @MONTH1 seem bland average or unattractive. Author Minfong Ho canverys the fact that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of simply stating the fact that she will retake the test, he has her make a promise on the geese that she will.

6887	10447	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test.	2	2		2																						128	8	139	2	0	0	4.46875	16.0	31	25	6	6	6	13	71	8.8	8.12	7.38	15	6.9	8.88	8.166666666666666	9.2	165
6890	10450	4	The short story “Winter Hibiscus” as written by author Minfong Ho, ends with main character Saeng, promising herself that in the spring when the geese return and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, that she would re-take her failed drivers test. Mingfong Ho, writes this story, with heavy imagery and symbolism, the hibiscus found in the floral shop, represents a connection for Saeng to her homeland, and the bittermellon, which is loved by Saeng, but unbearable to people in @LOCATION1 ,represents Saeng’s hard time connecting to people in @LOCATION1. And for Saeng, the budding hibiscus, and returning geese, are representative of a new opportunity to pass her drivers test, and better adapt to life in @LOCATION1.	3	3		3																						116	3	136	15	0	0	5.181034482758621	38.666666666666664	38	19	11	1	7	22	51	22.3	12.25	9.64	21	17.2	19.62	22.0	17.1	179
6891	10451	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wanted to show that Saeng doesn’t give up and that nature gives @CAPS1 strength. The conclusion shows that Saeng doesn’t give up by saying that she is going to take the test again, even though she failed it earlier that day. Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by saying that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return, when hibiscus buds and when the snow melts in spring nature gives her strength because it reminds her of where they used to live and her grandmother. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature gives her strength and confidence.	2	2		2																						125	4	134	5	0	0	4.672	31.25	35	23	1	5	5	12	72	16.2	9.93	7.97	13	12.0	14.12	18.0	10.7	163

6909	10469	4	I think the author ended the story like that because she enjoys to see the geese and she loves the spring and wants to take the test and pass.

6914	10474	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown. She has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too. nature’s fight for survival is like Saeng’s struggle in a new place. She discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time. Then after that time it will feel just like home. The adaption principle is shown throughout this story demonstrate by nature or a child’s life it’s there. Therefore the author would agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng.	3	2		3																						109	7	116	0	0	0	4.81651376146789	15.571428571428571	27	13	8	6	2	11	60	10.4	9.97	8.6	19	8.0	10.95	8.5	10.5	149

6935	10495	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she failed the test so over the winter they don’t get hibiscus but over the spring when they get again the hibiscus she will try to take the taste again so she can pass it	1	1		1																						46	1	46	0	0	0	4.195652173913044	46.0	9	9	0	3	1	1	31	21.4	7.97	7.98	3	16.5	19.27	25.0	0.0	56

6945	10505	4	Saeng is trying to say that when the time comes again that she will take the test. The author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test. The auther also does this to show that you should never quit like if the flower can survive winter then she will be able to survive that test. Also the author is saying that when the seasons change, things change. She was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence. Also she cherished the plant because she wants to see it budding because her and her mother spent quality time dve to this plant she had.	2	1		2																						133	6	140	1	0	0	4.368421052631579	22.166666666666668	24	29	4	6	3	8	84	10.2	7.78	7.35	13	8.4	10.08	10.4	7.8	167
6946	10506	4	Saeng is talking about her school work and the garden. She always connects the two of them in the same way. she knows that she has to study while the garden grows and she wants to water  the flowers and she is saying that when the spring comes she wont be there for the garden and she will have to take the test.	0	0		0																						63	3	68	0	0	0	3.90625	21.333333333333332	10	12	1	2	4	5	43	12.9	5.93	7.71	4	10.9	12.6	15.75	0.0	73
6948	10508	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that everything and everyone can make it through a tough time. This paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers. The text say, “when they come back... I will take that test again”. This quote shows that Saeng can see herself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She knows that her “winter” is her test and that when she is ready, she’ll be able to take the test again and be successful. The budding of the hibiscus represents the time when she’ll be prepared to take the test. Though she is having a tough tine now, she'll be able to get through it and make another attempt. This paragraph is at the end because it brings together the purpose of the hibiscus. Without saying this, the readers would have never gotten this message, instead, they would believe that the role of the hibiscus was to serve as a connection to Saeng’s past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph was included to show readers that everyone can balance back from a bad situation.	3	3		3																						187	11	205	7	0	0	4.60427807486631	17.0	40	27	11	7	5	23	118	8.7	8.47	7.1	19	7.6	8.73	7.2857142857142865	10.4	253
6954	10514	4	I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time.	0	0		0																						65	2	68	0	0	0	3.8181818181818183	33.0	16	13	0	3	3	6	40	29.3	5.65	9.05	6	23.9	26.62	33.5	0.0	78

When Saeng says,”and this hibiscus plant is budding,"" she is thinking about how the plant reminds her of her native country. Also when she says, ""Then I will take this test again” she is promising herself that she will take the test when she feels at home in her new country. Saeng also is in a way telling herself that she should accept the fact that she has moved and that she can still be reminded of her native country with the new hibiscus plant and many other things."	2	2		2																						137	4	147	4	0	0	4.211678832116788	34.25	32	20	6	4	4	10	87	15.5	7.27	7.41	9	11.9	14.3	17.0	8.1	164
6956	10517	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She could want the people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start up again so will Saeng. Ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and geese restarts their lives Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but instead re-take the test. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves you thinking so then the sequel will be about the start of Saeng’s new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 love having people wonder about whats coming next. The people will go home and wonder what will the author do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer.	2	2		2																						178	12	194	1	0	0	4.264044943820225	14.833333333333334	39	36	9	12	6	15	107	6.0	6.37	6.23	9	4.3	5.92	6.142857142857143	4.8	217
6962	10523	4	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time.	2	2		2																						93	4	100	5	0	0	4.787234042553192	23.5	19	17	9	4	2	14	51	16.9	11.04	9.11	17	14.1	15.76	18.166666666666668	12.5	135
6980	10543	4	There are two reasons why he had conclude the story with this pararagraph. The one reason why the author had conclude the story with the paragraph because Saeng had silently had picked up a Winter Hibiscus so she can have to passed that driving Test. Finally; the last reason why the author had conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to try her driving Test again so she can passed so she can also drive when she gets down passing it. These two reasons were so confusing to figure out what the author conclude in the story with that sentence.	1	1		1																						102	4	107	0	0	0	4.5	25.5	20	16	2	5	0	6	64	12.5	8.83	7.07	9	9.7	10.98	13.25	8.1	136
6982	10545	4	There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time.	3	3		3																						164	9	186	11	0	0	4.502958579881657	18.77777777777778	35	25	9	16	3	30	96	16.8	9.53	8.54	19	12.5	15.07	13.5	10.4	212
6983	10546	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus when Saeng says that she will take the test again in the spring, so she can walk home and see the flower that she found. Also in the story it mentions that in her past childhood she had seen the same flower in her country, but the next time she takes the driving test she would like to pass. It shows that she was disapointed because in the story it say that she paid over nineteen dollars for the test. Her mother was astionished, and yelled at her for a second. Saeng began crying and her mother calmed to show sympathy for her. Now she has the determination to take the test again.	1	1		1																						118	6	127	3	0	0	4.203389830508475	19.666666666666668	23	23	3	5	4	11	75	8.2	6.67	6.62	9	7.4	9.57	10.6	8.3	150
7000	10563	4	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with a sentence stating that when Saeng’s Hibiscus’ first bud appears in the spring she will be back to take drivers test. The author might have decided to conclude the story like that because what if the plant died, would she go back and take the test? The author was probably just wanting the reader to think hard about it. In conclusion, the author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” might have concluded his story to make it somewhat suspenseful.	1	1		1																						89	4	95	2	0	1	4.719101123595506	22.25	22	13	4	6	1	10	51	11.9	9.99	7.4	13	9.6	11.62	13.125	11.2	126
7006	10569	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because if the author trys it again it might work out a lot better now they know what they are doing. Also if they try it again then if it makes enough they can sell it and make money so they will keep doing it for years to come.	0	0		0																						60	2	62	0	0	0	3.9166666666666665	30.0	8	12	1	6	1	2	43	12.0	5.82	6.7	3	10.3	12.0	15.0	0.0	72
7012	10575	4	The author includes this paragraph inorder to show an end to the story and to  show that Saeng has not given up. Ho wanted to show how the plant and the geese represented the continueation of Saeng’s life in the United States. The geese will come back and the Hibiscus will bud and flower, and Saeng will retake and  hopefoly pass her diving test. This paragraph is not just a colosing but a new beginging of life for geasse, a Winter Hibiscus, and Saeng.	1	2		2																						84	4	93	3	0	0	4.325581395348837	21.5	28	10	3	2	8	14	46	9.8	7.78	7.5	13	9.1	10.3	11.75	9.5	114
7015	10578	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to that she still has hope of finding home and being happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. So when the plant budds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy, that is when she will take the driving test. Also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting acustomed to the new home and lifestyle, “A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks deer and–yes–familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.” Through these examples I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show Saeng assimilation into her new lifestyle, and her acception of her situation.	3	2		3																						160	6	175	10	0	0	4.70625	26.666666666666668	36	18	12	15	5	20	94	16.8	10.05	7.79	22	13.4	15.8	14.0	12.7	227
7020	10584	4	Saeng concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows what she has just been through and feels she could go through it again. If she fails the driving test again, then she use the plants to overcome her problems. She @MONTH1 actually pass the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and believes now that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood.	1	1		1																						76	4	81	1	0	0	4.671052631578948	19.0	13	14	3	6	2	7	47	10.1	9.34	8.32	10	6.0	9.71	10.5	8.8	94
7027	10591	4	The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the “Madagascar periwinkle” growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.	1	1		1																						124	6	131	1	0	0	4.548387096774194	20.666666666666668	25	18	5	10	1	12	73	10.3	8.76	8.1	14	7.8	9.89	11.0	9.3	160

For example, the author says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become , through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her now.” That tells me that she feels that over same time , she will become more familiar with driving and then she will take the test again.

7031	10595	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to @LOCATION1 and has had a rough time fitting in. She misses everything about her old home, from her grandmother to the old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels that all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the winter and bloom in the spring and that is what Saeng realizes she must do. The last paragraph said “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring is the time for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers start to bloom, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes she wants a new beginning as well to be brought I the spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph ties the theme of new beginnings into the story. It shows @CAPS1 new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it.	3	2		3																						191	11	210	8	0	0	4.492146596858639	17.363636363636363	49	31	15	5	8	26	102	9.3	8.12	7.06	20	7.2	9.32	7.7142857142857135	11.0	254
7033	10597	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. First, when the hibiscus buds in the spring that means that the plant is about to bloom. That also means that Saeng will be ready in the spring to take the test again. Also the last paragraph is at the end because if the plant can make it, then the girl can pass her drivers test and be happy both ways.	1	1		1																						72	4	78	2	0	0	4.222222222222222	18.0	17	8	5	5	1	7	47	7.4	6.44	6.28	5	5.6	7.76	8.5	7.2	87
7037	10601	4	The author concludes this story with the few words “then I will take that test again.” because she wanted us to know that she is not going to give up on something she failed once.

Here the hibiscus mean  hope. Second of all when she said “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding “ she  means that is comfort for her it strong than hope and more if her mom helps her blue in her  self because is not easy to do it without her mom comfort. Lastly she said”Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and yes familiar to saeng  now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of a strange before had became, through the quiet repetitions of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She mean that the season is coming and the hibiscus  grow she will regain the blive  and the strength that she need to have to take the test the hibiscus means a lot to her means vew  hopes ,comfort, and belive.	2	3		3																						204	8	225	8	0	0	4.1415094339622645	26.5	47	27	17	12	8	22	114	19.0	7.91	7.36	10	15.7	17.3	18.333333333333332	12.3	268

7056	10620	4	I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her.	2	1		2																						152	7	161	3	0	0	4.342105263157895	21.714285714285715	31	27	7	5	4	11	86	14.2	8.02	7.22	16	11.6	14.27	13.75	10.8	204
7058	10622	4	I think the author concludes the story with that saying because it shows that she is adappting to the new place. It @CAPS1 shows that she isent going to give up.

7069	10633	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes the story a happy ending how she doesn’t give up and is taking the test again.

7076	10640	4	The author uses this conclusion for a reason. The reason the author uses this cliff-hanges of a conclusion is to keep the reader interested and wanting more. By saying,”I will take that test again,” the author makes the reader question if Saeng will pass the test next time and the reader will wonder what “the test” is.	1	1		1																						57	4	62	2	0	0	4.631578947368421	14.25	20	8	3	0	2	9	30	9.9	8.99	6.52	4	8.3	8.3	10.5	8.8	78
7077	10641	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesn’t want the snow to melt so that the geese wouldnt return.

7080	11828	5	"Throughout the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, manages to maintain a single overall mood. In many parts of the story he tells about how much he loved his childhood so it lead me to think was nostalgia, but nowhere does it emphasize that he yearns to return to past times. He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became"" family"" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states how his parents were so brave to leave their lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times on how his parents helped so many in need. If in Rodriguez's position I would love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and upbringing of their son."	2	2		2																						167	7	186	9	0	0	4.425149700598802	23.857142857142858	35	22	14	10	6	19	105	11.4	8.01	7.85	24	9.1	11.0	11.0	9.2	220

I got this mood because he is always talking about being together with his family and how the home he was brought up in truly brought everyone in his family together and this made him proud of his family and his Cuban Culture. His family meant a lot to him so another mood could be love because of his love for his family and the house he grew up in where he learned to love. His parents did a lot for him and, ""Turned their simple house into a home"". He learned everything he could ever think about from his parents and he loves them a lot. These are the moods I felt while reading Narciso Rodriguez."	4	2		3																						133	6	142	1	0	0	4.18796992481203	22.166666666666668	29	18	2	5	6	10	85	9.4	6.56	6.28	8	8.4	9.18	15.0	10.9	175

The examples of how it is happy are the way the author describes in paragraph @NUM1 how his parents were able to afford to move into a better and larger house, ""twenty-one-year-old @PERSON2 and twenty-seven-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, @NUM2-room apartment."" @CAPS1 example of the happiness is when he is describing the time when his parents were decorating the appartment to look like a traditional-cuban home, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" @CAPS1 example of happiness is when he describes his community of united and hard-working immigrants, ""In our neighborhood all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And the final example is when he mentions that lot's of his family and friends grace their kitchen table more times than not. The mood changes about halfway through the memoir in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and carrers in the country they loved."" This is when the parents are leaving Cuba and their families and friends to take on a life in @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 example of sadness is when it says ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" This means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in @LOCATION1, and they might not get the pay they deserve.

7327	12075	5	The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort.	3	3		3																						126	10	138	2	0	0	4.238095238095238	12.6	22	15	12	5	2	11	80	4.8	5.84	5.77	9	4.7	5.67	5.75	7.6	166

This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them.	3	3		3																						168	8	187	9	0	0	4.369047619047619	21.0	38	22	9	9	9	19	107	9.7	7.43	6.46	15	9.1	9.59	8.666666666666666	11.2	231

7552	12300	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood created by the author is lifting because it shows that race doesn't matter when it comes to unity or friendship. It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so that their family can live a better life. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how the family doesn't have to neccisarily blood related and can be someone you love and will help you. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting.	2	2		2																						103	5	111	0	0	0	4.378640776699029	20.6	19	18	1	2	4	6	67	9.5	7.66	6.5	8	10.1	9.41	12.0	11.2	150

His parents decided to immigrate to give him a better life, at the expense of their families, friends, jobs, and their country.Another reason why the author was grateful was because the author learned that ""family"" was not just a blood relative, but much more. In the piece of text, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. From this snippet, I can tell that the author was grateful for learning the true meaning of family.

In the text, the quote, ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" From this quote, I can gather that his parents were grateful. Most people would've given up from the tall and wide barrier in their way. His parents could've given up, but they didn't.

Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst.

If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, ”Rough Road Ahead” which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."	3	3		3																						251	7	271	11	0	0	4.386454183266932	35.857142857142854	62	44	12	15	9	30	137	17.2	8.25	8.88	33	13.8	15.16	17.0	8.0	319

For example in paragraph five they use alot of adjectives to describe how abandon the place was. Words like ramshackle and rusty. Also how often the lack of water was brung up made us think of how hott this California desert must have been. Also the heat made the cyclist belive he was seeing a miracle when he saw the Welch’s fruit juice factory.

One of these settings were the rough terrains he had to pass through where he lacked on the amount of water.Another setting the cyclist had to go through was the hill like terrains.Where he was laughing at himself for taking the old men advice in the first place.Both of these features had a great a tall on the cyclist body strength and his spirit.

3673	6069	3	The features of the setting affect the the cyclist by giving him obstacles to overcome when he had to go down the winding hills, he would have to slow down so he could manuver the hills and not lose control of the bike. The heat he was facing would cause tiredness and dehydration. If exposed to the sun and heat long enough you can get a sunburn or suffer a heat stroke. A heat stroke can be fatal to anyone, especially those with heart problems. Dehydration also can be fatal. If the cyclist does not see any buildings, he would not be able to tell where he is and he might get lost because of it. Getting lost will also lead to dehydration, tiredness, and heat stroke.	1	2		2																						127	7	139	5	0	0	4.291338582677166	18.142857142857142	26	19	4	6	6	12	79	7.8	6.78	6.9	16	6.8	8.18	8.0	8.0	166
3674	6070	3	The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder.

The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it “Over on long, crippling hill”. The word “crippling“ is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist’s ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding.	1	2		2																						117	8	127	4	0	0	4.52991452991453	14.625	26	17	7	11	4	18	65	8.3	8.12	7.7	15	5.1	8.05	7.666666666666666	7.4	146

If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won’t be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly infront of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist.

When @CAPS1 hot, the heat dehydrates you. So the narrator was being pushed to the limit because of the heat. Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was hauntinghim until he got mad at the lodgers hetalked to and was really frustrated. The smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills, which made it harder for him to ride. Lastly, the snake inthe road affected him because he had to avoid it.

Meaning that he   didn’t mind or wasn’t   troubled   by it  at the time. But the farther his trip went, the hotter, and less water supply he had left. Once he passed a couple of “troubling sights”, because they were abandoned and no one   was around, he began to worry. The cyclist got to the point that he stated to suck on pebbtes, in order to circulate the last spit he had in his mouth. In his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on.

3738	6134	3	Many features in the setting affect the cyclist. Several main features include the cars lading town. that aint really towns anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could give him water, but it was all run down and weakened. “I arrived at the first “town”. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.” He is saying that the town could’ve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed He tried to pump water but got no success. “I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t cool down.” A working water pump would’ve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading	2	2		2																						155	11	170	5	0	0	4.458064516129032	14.090909090909092	44	23	12	10	8	21	83	10.6	7.83	7.99	20	8.4	9.61	10.6	8.8	203

Also that the water felt around two-hundred degrees. That sweat was all over him. So he had to be really hot. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performence. How was because he was dieing in need of water. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong and the trip wasnt what he expected. But in the end he was relifed. So even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive.

3784	6180	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically.	3	2		3																						225	17	250	10	0	0	4.702222222222222	13.235294117647058	47	33	23	8	9	33	125	8.7	8.93	7.17	27	7.2	7.86	10.8	8.2	305

Also there was hills on his travel that he had to ride his bike up which takes more  energy so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat, finally, because of the terrain he was riding on the animals he ran into, a snake, could have hurt him. Because the setting of the story was in the desert the cyclist was affected more then he had thought he would be.	2	2		2																						123	5	133	4	0	0	3.9919354838709675	24.8	23	16	6	8	1	10	83	9.8	5.87	6.4	8	9.3	10.82	13.75	9.4	157
3827	6223	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who haven’t seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldn’t have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldn’t have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his “dehydrated state.” I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldn’t focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldn’t get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite.	3	2		3																						181	10	198	7	0	0	4.49171270718232	18.1	42	35	4	8	4	21	108	8.8	7.89	7.24	19	8.0	8.79	8.0	9.1	250
3843	6239	3	Setting is a very important element to the story “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit: by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative, for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1 the story would not be as interesting.	3	0		2																						160	7	177	7	0	0	4.94375	22.857142857142858	44	15	21	8	7	18	85	13.3	11.09	7.73	25	12.2	12.66	10.666666666666666	14.1	256
3847	6243	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration.	2	2		2																						137	9	157	9	0	0	4.7898550724637685	15.333333333333334	36	17	12	7	4	17	77	8.9	9.33	7.73	23	6.9	8.71	7.7142857142857135	9.7	196
3849	6245	3	"The features of the setting affect the cy clist in many ways. For example the lack of water was the biggest thing. Without cool water he had nothing to reboost his energy. He would get tired out faster. Even he does find water its hot, like when he says,” brakish water feeling some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This shows how in “the high desert of June,"" the water is all very hot. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes the water still wouldn’t cool down the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot. Also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it. We know the roads rough when he says, “large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.

3856	6252	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the road could be damaged or there could be a lot of hills. One example is on pg @NUM1 “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat”. This explains the conditions of the road could be dangerous. That is how the condition of the road can be affective.	1	1		1																						62	4	65	0	0	0	4.129032258064516	15.5	16	6	2	0	2	8	37	5.8	5.91	7.97	9	5.8	8.78	8.0	9.5	79

But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and cough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence, as he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terain he says,"" i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the queruring that he says,"" i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”.

3867	6263	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the @DATE1 then his water supply would’ve lasted longer and he would’ve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would’ve died. Luckily though it wasn’t and he was able to drink water.The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice something the cyclist could’nt do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him. Since I’ve fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy.	3	3		3																						197	11	212	3	0	0	4.47979797979798	18.0	40	34	6	17	5	19	117	10.7	8.41	7.05	18	9.5	10.38	11.4	11.0	270

At first he seemed at case talking about the cool pines and rushing rivers he was going to encounter once getting to Yosemite. After a strenuous ride he started to get nervous and wonder if he was even going to survive. He was running out of water and he thought be a diamondback. Once he reached the rolling hills he saw a posted speed limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m.p.h. He was doing a ''water depleting 12 m.p.h. wonder how he was going to survive. At the end of the rolling hills he came to an old Welch’s grape factory wondering his life was so cruel. After that he was determined to survive and make it to his destination. He picked out spoke on horizon and rode to them makes his way across the desert.

The weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough, but giving through a desert with limited water had to be miserable. The warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigue. This delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well. Not only did he have to through tough weather but hazardous condition too. There were times when “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”. This delayed him and took time to cycle around. As you can see this was a difficult journey for the reader and the affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						116	8	124	1	0	0	4.672413793103448	14.5	24	15	12	9	8	10	68	7.8	8.75	7.49	18	6.6	8.56	7.142857142857142	9.2	159
3885	6281	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good.

3888	6284	3	After the cyclist spoke to the “old timers who hadn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded.	3	3		3																						177	8	193	9	0	0	4.5875706214689265	22.125	43	30	10	7	10	25	91	10.0	8.76	8.27	30	8.6	10.14	8.166666666666666	10.3	247

3980	6376	3	The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all he rides into barren land. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying “it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This was in response to the first “town” he came across. Next he speaks of a large snake that came close to him which is dangerous, but luckily he manuvers out of its way. But the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water.

The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water.

He says that he “had been nitting my water bottles pretty regularly. “@CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, for the demonsrtrating just how much he needed water. The wate in this pump, the owner said, was, “somewhere in the neighbar had of two hundred degrees. If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, “ghost town” infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; “there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn’t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid.

It can get very hot there,like the writer describes, “wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.” The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed.	2	2		2																						129	9	148	9	0	0	4.682170542635659	14.333333333333334	37	18	5	7	1	21	74	8.7	8.7	7.01	16	7.2	7.68	6.857142857142857	8.1	181

He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do.

While he is riding, he sees surrounding him” no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclution of the setting, having only seen “One ramshackle shed in many miles, the cyclist almost looses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of “the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.” That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope.	2	2		2																						112	4	125	9	0	0	4.455357142857143	28.0	33	13	4	5	3	20	60	13.6	8.01	8.83	20	11.8	13.34	14.0	10.7	152

4088	6484	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with “His name written over them”. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. “That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map.	3	3		3																						179	9	192	5	0	0	4.290502793296089	19.88888888888889	47	26	14	6	4	19	93	10.0	7.43	7.57	22	8.5	11.64	8.666666666666666	11.0	239
4089	6485	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, “I arrived at the first “Town”…this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, “short, rolling hills” (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn’t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist’s journey in a negative way.	3	3		3																						255	11	286	15	0	0	4.412451361867705	23.363636363636363	64	31	25	9	4	35	145	11.1	8.07	7.88	37	10.0	11.95	14.5	10.4	346

4115	6511	3	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclist’s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speaker’s journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																						97	8	107	2	0	0	4.546391752577319	12.125	31	10	3	2	1	11	57	6.1	7.58	7.0	9	4.5	6.08	5.8125	8.1	128
4128	6524	3	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he/she thought they would die. The setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat. Finally the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men because the cyclist didn’t make it where he/she wanted to go.	2	2		2																						77	5	87	1	0	0	4.753246753246753	15.4	18	12	5	4	2	8	47	8.6	9.39	7.27	10	6.9	7.72	7.5	8.2	110

As he hit the @NUM1 town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water. As the flat rodes were replaced wI short, rolling hills he became even more troubled.  When he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to Yosemite. As the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless.

4138	6534	3	The settings to this story has an encouraging impact on this story, because he is an alike ride. The terrain in the story sounds rough where he seen a sign marked, ‘Rough road ahead do note exceed posted speed limit.” He already has to go up and down hills with rocks and no water. Such a setting an a really athletic ride can be devastating.	1	1		1																						65	4	70	2	0	0	4.276923076923077	16.25	15	9	5	4	2	7	36	9.6	6.96	7.87	9	9.4	10.53	12.166666666666666	9.7	88
4139	6535	3	The feature of the cyclist and the settings arn’t that good. There’re insidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn’t have any energic to get up.

4153	6549	3	There were several features of the setting that held an affect on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert. This condition normally prevents one from obtaining water. Seeing as how water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack there at due to the desert created the conflict of dehydration. Additionally, the town that was abandoned triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclist’s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope. By the time he/she reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now his head is screaming with annoyance and his body is screaming with lack of water. This abandoned juice factory almost completely wiped out the cyclist hope. A man is little to nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative affect on him. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her desperation of survival, an instinct in all of us. In conclusion, the desert removed water and the abandoned homes and factory removed hope and all three created a negative affect. The cyclist is lucky to have survived.	1	1		1																						195	14	221	8	0	0	4.758974358974359	13.928571428571429	53	24	11	10	5	22	110	8.0	9.04	7.24	30	7.5	8.84	7.571428571428571	10.5	291
4165	6561	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot, him not having anything to drink, nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages. In the essay it states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.” This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding enviroment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasen’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. “The cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one.	2	2		2																						184	8	198	6	0	0	4.309782608695652	23.0	44	32	9	8	7	21	104	14.2	7.85	8.42	23	11.7	13.58	13.5	9.3	241
4168	6564	3	Nature has an affect on everyone, even when they don’t think it does. Expecially for cyclist traveling anywhere or everywhere. In “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example about settings laffect people like cyclist. When you’re riding your bike as actually cross country transportation, you have to know what your doing and where you’re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route for a cyclist because at these “town” they had no water, because they weren’t towns to begin with, not anymore atleast. If you don’t have any water like this guy did hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example.” l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones help take your mind off thrist” This guy knew a little bit of survival tips. If he’d gone all that way without standing up yo his thrist and those hills, he probably would have had some kind of stroke. That is just a few way that setting could harm you.	3	3		3																						196	11	212	6	0	0	4.454081632653061	17.818181818181817	51	38	7	9	6	29	107	9.3	8.07	8.23	27	7.4	9.47	11.8	9.1	257
4169	6565	3	Some of the feature setting that effect the cyclist was the seal was begging to lent down, but he truly noticed it and about twenty miles up the road he came to park of sorts. The cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June. He get on his hands and hence working on the heated handle of the rusty pump. The pump began it shoot out a tarlike substance and the water was feeling somewhere of two hundred degrees. Two more miles I noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to a short, rolling hills.” He said tumble weeds crossed her path and a large snake crossed her pavement. He gather some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, after reading that if sucking of stones helps to be your mind off thirst. Well after reading of I believed these settings did effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						149	8	159	3	0	0	4.369127516778524	18.625	37	23	8	4	6	12	82	9.8	7.66	7.98	18	8.1	8.79	10.2	5.3	190
4171	6567	3	In the story Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the features had a more negative affect on the cyclist. The cyclist got tired because of the big hills and he liked the scene which was they only good that if had on hon. “The water bottle only contained a few tantallizg sips.” he didnt have enough water and he was thirsty. “At some point a rediculously large  snak it really did look like dimond back–bloked the majority of the pavement.” It is dangerous where he was riding and even though he was on a bike he could have been bit. All of these points I made showed the negative affect.	1	1		1																						116	5	123	0	0	0	4.299145299145299	23.4	26	11	12	7	3	15	66	18.3	8.08	8.96	14	16.0	17.2	29.0	13.0	157

4190	6587	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie there were many settings that affect the cyclist. One example would be when he came up to a water pump and he tried to get water out but water didn’t come out. “…working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out….” (Kurmaskie). Another example is when he came across rolling hills, and the scaring heat, he also came across a snake that took up most of the pavement.	1	1		1																						93	6	104	2	0	0	4.2	15.833333333333334	27	15	3	1	4	14	49	10.4	7.26	8.02	12	8.8	10.18	12.875	9.5	122
4192	6589	3	The setting in the story was hot. The biker was sweating a lot. The whole town was empty. He pasted empty buildings. Their were rivers and big hills that he had to ride through. As it says about the buildings, “somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” The setting would affect the cyclist because their was no one in the town. Also, their was high hills.	1	1		1																						77	8	88	4	0	0	4.6103896103896105	9.625	19	10	6	5	2	12	44	5.8	7.35	7.46	10	4.0	4.92	4.785714285714286	6.2	101
4195	6592	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. “A rediculously large snake” this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.” I could drop from heat stroke” another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.” There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.” The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.” This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist.	3	2		3																						139	8	147	3	0	0	4.3428571428571425	17.5	36	14	11	7	7	18	83	22.3	8.43	8.43	14	17.8	19.67	28.0	11.9	182
4200	6597	3	In many real-life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest hindrance in succeeding, or even surviving. For example, the cyclist with stood the blozing heat of the sun as he pedaled through what seemed to be the @CAPS1’s living room: Dry, desolate, and extremely scornful. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS2 and depicts the intense heats of the desert. Another feature in the setting was the every hanging hills and steps though pedaling down the hills was an easier task, traveling up the hill, as well  as maneuvering the thirsts and bends served as a direct conflict. An example, “with what I believed was my last burst of energy I maneuvered a setting affect a situation is ultimately, the cyclist reached his destination is great relief. But the biggest hindrance was along his setting.	3	3		3																						157	6	177	10	0	0	4.772151898734177	26.333333333333332	45	20	12	5	9	24	81	16.9	10.34	9.92	36	14.4	16.64	20.0	14.3	232
4210	6607	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the author goes through many seneries. All of the places that the author goes to make him even more determined because he wants to find water and he just wants to get to Yosemite. The determination pushes him to keep going further and further. And then the determination finally pays off after he goes around a turn because he then see’s a place where he can get something to drink and a place to cool down.	2	1		2																						82	4	86	0	0	0	4.365853658536586	20.5	14	16	3	8	4	7	53	9.4	7.78	6.58	5	7.7	9.18	11.25	8.8	107

He reached a ramshackle shed and began to lose hope. He loses water quickly and becomes more dehydrated. The terrain become slopes and hills and the ride become harder, when he reached the grape drink factory his hopes were almost gone. But just over the hill was a fishing shop.

4258	6655	3	The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men who’s information was not accurate. Then he cycled along the desert which was very hot. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way. He almost had a heat stroke a few times. He was probably angry that he took these men’s advice and got himself into this. Then when he found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So it’s really confusing because he probably felt relived and mad at the same time. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn’t, the old man would have gave him some more messed up direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke.	3	2		3																						174	10	189	5	0	0	4.126436781609195	17.4	28	18	20	17	6	18	113	6.7	5.86	6.5	15	6.5	9.03	7.142857142857142	9.9	222

Also being that he didn’t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own.	1	2		2																						87	6	96	3	0	0	4.137931034482759	14.5	13	13	8	9	3	10	54	5.3	5.5	6.53	4	4.2	6.26	6.416666666666667	5.5	108

I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.” This shows how he is doubtful.

4281	6678	3	The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? “ It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” The heat must have been bad, he wasn’t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men “helping” with directions.	2	2		2																						108	9	123	5	1	1	4.541284403669724	12.11111111111111	20	15	12	8	6	20	57	6.9	7.94	7.52	17	6.2	7.25	6.0	8.5	146
4283	6680	3	The features of the setting in the story “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting’s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story.	2	3		3																						192	9	218	15	0	0	4.583333333333333	21.333333333333332	53	22	14	5	5	32	107	12.1	8.77	8.61	34	10.3	11.89	11.2	10.7	264
4284	6681	3	The cyclit of “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was “@NUM1 degers”. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would’ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story.	2	2		2																						125	7	142	10	0	0	4.674603174603175	18.0	35	19	7	10	3	23	63	9.6	8.87	9.07	22	7.9	10.04	8.833333333333334	10.0	174
4289	6686	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.	2	3		3																						80	5	85	0	0	0	3.6625	16.0	16	12	8	2	4	6	47	3.8	3.3	6.4	6	4.8	7.4	7.6	7.6	95
4290	6687	3	The setting from the story left the cyclist in a mental way because most of the time the sun was on his mind due to the fact that he was pedaling hard in a hot summer day in June. The cyclist had very little water and with him biking under a beating sun wasn’t exactly helping him. He  had to like disasterous events like, peddling slopes than the normal speed, a snake blocking the path, old men telling to take a different route then be infected, and the fact that his water supply was low made him think he was going to pass out under the burning sun. However his determination was strong as he continued on pedaling through and he eventually found himself in another town but this time with people, fish and water.	2	2		2																						135	4	145	5	0	0	4.294117647058823	34.0	32	21	10	6	5	12	73	15.8	7.96	7.77	16	14.1	15.59	18.333333333333332	12.6	187

The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn to a semi brutal experience “it got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, “This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration. It lead: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT @CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT.”This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the  cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. “at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS2, this quote show of some of the dangers the  cyclist encountered. If  these features did not appear, then maybe the story would be describing a nice bike ride, but once you read about them, it becomes more of a disaster."	3	3		3																						201	9	231	12	0	0	4.759803921568627	22.666666666666668	55	28	14	14	4	34	100	18.0	10.4	8.91	33	14.0	16.19	14.5	13.3	286

From this quote; “a ton-like substance oozed out.” This quote shows how after @NUM1 miles of pedaling when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point his one chance of water had been depleated. The next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out. He said, “I hung my head” this shows how he almost completely lost all hope and that he was sure that he is going to die."	3	3		3																						139	6	148	1	0	0	4.100719424460432	23.166666666666668	32	23	8	3	2	18	78	15.3	6.63	7.98	14	12.1	15.36	18.0	9.5	170
4304	6701	3	During the cyclist’s biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town This sight doesn’t immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain. Eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief. As evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence.	3	2		3																						170	9	181	2	0	0	4.876470588235295	18.88888888888889	48	22	13	7	2	16	88	11.0	10.62	9.13	35	10.7	11.8	13.2	13.0	265

4310	6707	3	The harsh features at the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along “The high deserts of California in June”, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small “gost towns” rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as “Short rolling hills” through ghost the terrain and ever a snake. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey etc.	2	3		3																						134	6	141	1	0	0	4.865671641791045	22.333333333333332	38	19	9	5	4	13	66	12.7	10.91	9.57	28	10.8	12.5	11.6	11.5	197
4315	6712	3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness.	3	3		3																						141	11	161	9	0	0	4.333333333333333	12.818181818181818	33	20	12	9	6	20	79	5.4	6.13	7.97	24	4.7	7.67	6.25	8.8	189
4317	6714	3	The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as ‘the sun was beating down” and “high deserts of California in June” to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says “short rolling hills”, “tumbleweeds” and “long, crippling hill” to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower.  Finally, the cyclist is faced with a “rediculously large snake” and plants and weeds which get in his way and force him to slow down.	2	2		2																						105	4	113	3	0	0	4.811320754716981	26.5	26	17	13	3	8	17	49	18.9	11.04	9.28	16	14.6	17.05	14.75	13.0	148
4323	6720	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. They make it hard to concentrate, because its heat, they make it unbearable.

4324	6721	3	In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite. If the setting wouldn't have been so bad, the long ride wouldnt have been as hard on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a California desert, when he did find a well he said, “ followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. ” @CAPS1 thing about the setting is, if it wouldnt have been so hot, he wouldnt have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said “  I  could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. ” In conclusion, the setting played a major role in the story.	2	1		2																						145	7	169	10	0	0	4.190476190476191	21.0	30	14	11	10	1	19	90	13.0	7.09	7.14	15	11.1	12.7	13.25	9.4	194
4327	6724	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist by showing the rough conditions he went through, and somehow perservered through. The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the rolling hills. Followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This shows the struggle he went through and supports the setting story and how it affected his trip. This also shows how he perserverd through his struggles and made an effort to finish.	1	1		1																						88	5	95	4	0	0	5.034090909090909	17.6	21	18	3	4	5	12	46	13.3	11.31	9.21	18	9.5	10.16	12.0	8.8	123
4328	6725	3	The riders condition was rough, from flat land to rolling hills. This would be hard for some one who is dehydrating. There was a snake in his path so he went around it.

In this essay he under estimates the dder cyclist. When really they are the people with more knowledge. Some of the things that @MONTH1 be hard for cyclist are the rough roads. Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke. As road get worse chances get higher tumble weeds and snakes in the way, he was determined to win. After all was said and he faced the horror that nature brought him he knew he was wrong wrong for them and the intelligants.	2	3		3																						154	12	167	1	0	0	4.311688311688312	12.833333333333334	35	22	13	9	6	15	90	5.3	6.25	6.94	16	4.7	6.68	5.222222222222222	7.8	206
4340	6737	3	Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride.	1	1		1																						69	4	73	0	0	0	4.231884057971015	17.25	15	8	4	4	2	5	45	7.1	6.61	7.47	7	6.5	8.66	8.625	8.8	89
4344	6741	3	Early in the morning, the cyclist is eager and ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older travelers. He hardly noticed the “sun was beginning to beat down.” He was calm and was looking forward to the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” Never once did he imagine what he had gotten himself into. As he began to approach the desert, he noticed he was running low on water. The strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect. The cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put pebbles into his mouth. He had once read, “that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” The cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across. Dehydration took it’s toll, and he felt hallucinations. He was beginning to lose hope. The heat and the hills and the lack of water had the greatest affect on the cyclist. Had he not been riding through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been fine.	3	2		3																						197	12	212	5	0	0	4.365482233502538	16.416666666666668	40	35	10	11	6	24	110	9.0	7.49	7.82	27	7.4	9.71	11.2	9.4	264
4350	6747	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse at minute from heat exaustion. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						103	4	112	5	0	0	4.495145631067961	25.75	28	9	3	4	2	11	62	12.6	8.54	7.52	15	11.0	13.04	14.25	10.7	145
4358	6755	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die … “(Kurmaskie).	3	2		3																						94	8	108	4	0	0	4.5473684210526315	11.875	18	19	6	6	7	15	56	6.1	7.29	7.08	12	5.5	6.85	5.625	8.1	132
4369	6766	3	The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was “going to drop from heat exsostion”, he is riding through the desert in @DATE1, and he took directions from three old “gentlemen” sitting on a porch.	1	1		1																						50	2	54	2	0	0	4.4	25.0	13	7	2	0	1	6	29	11.8	7.96	6.77	5	9.5	11.6	13.5	0.0	65
4371	6768	3	Well first off its very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily. And the hills are hard to get up so it would be a challange to get to the top.

4382	6779	3	The setting in  “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist. He was tacking through the “high desert of California in June”. June is a hot part of the year and since he was in the hottest desert part the hot was multiplied. The terrain changing into “short rolling hills” didn’t help the cyclist. The hills would make any riding more difficult. Anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement. With the person lack of water anyone would be struggling to keep riding on. Most people didn’t have that hints to keep moving. He didn’t set a very goal he just went to the “next Horizon”. Shouldn’t he just wanted to keep going. Another problem with the physical environment was the road conditions. When the “Rough Road Affect” sign appeared the travel then become more difficult. A bike tire take more effort to go over uneven pavement is why the cyclist had so much trouble.	3	3		3																						176	11	188	0	0	0	4.451977401129944	16.09090909090909	49	32	14	6	1	22	97	6.4	7.65	7.54	24	6.2	6.76	6.714285714285714	8.1	241
4383	6780	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way. With only a few sips of water left he said'' … abandoned years earlieR, by the looks of it it had been a @CAPS1 Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of Juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.'' When only having a few drops of water and seeing that would have increased my thirst more. Another way the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way was "" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. sometime ife can feel so cruel.'' This remind him that hes not in a car, and that hes not even going half the speed limit. The setting affects the cyclist by reminding him how long his journey is, and now at this point he is suffering."	3	2		3																						164	10	185	3	0	0	4.163636363636364	16.5	45	23	8	9	4	19	87	7.5	6.03	7.63	19	6.8	8.96	8.5	9.2	220
4389	6786	3	The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the “ghost town” early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned welch’s Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, “It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1, his suffering was through when he discovered a “fish camp,” with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist’s relief was so immense that he,” had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them.	1	1		1																						191	8	214	13	0	0	4.539267015706806	23.875	49	23	19	12	6	32	99	11.9	8.54	8.87	31	10.3	11.65	11.8	10.7	261
4392	6789	3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town he’s tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he’s tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He’s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is greatful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story the cyclists needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relived.	2	3		3																						140	7	149	3	0	0	4.171428571428572	20.0	26	19	12	8	7	9	82	9.9	6.85	6.71	12	7.7	10.75	11.2	10.1	174
4395	6792	3	The setting affect the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay. The mood of the essay I think is a sort of dry summer day, the sort of “oh my gosh, its really hot,” type thing. The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, tumble weeds and more to contribut to the hopeless feeling. Although he was secured, and didn’t die, it seemed like he would surely not make it judging by the lack of water, scorching hot sun, and distance, with enduring these conditions. So the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him.	2	2		2																						112	5	126	10	0	0	4.348214285714286	22.4	33	15	6	3	4	18	58	10.3	7.43	8.27	16	8.5	10.39	14.0	9.4	149
4403	6800	3	"The setting acts as a catylist in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is always challenging the character untill the very end. In the story it says “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says “The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.” This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him it also shows how is risle he is, and how satiricle life can be. The ultimate @CAPS1 in this story is when he stumbels across the welches grape juice factory and there was a piture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” No matter where the cycalist goes he is alway trying to overcome the elements."	2	3		3																						146	9	158	2	0	0	4.219178082191781	16.22222222222222	36	17	8	9	2	22	84	7.6	6.62	8.22	25	8.1	9.79	7.0	9.8	198
4409	6806	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when the author says “flat roads were replace by short rolling hills”, that made the author have to ride safer. Also, when he says,” the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.” The author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past. Finally when the author says “no one in sight”, no building, car, or structure”, he is affected because he can’t ask questions since hes lost and hes thirsty. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go.	1	2		2																						114	6	127	7	0	0	4.359649122807017	19.0	26	22	8	4	4	16	63	10.5	7.67	7.95	11	8.6	10.87	11.2	9.9	146
4411	6808	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined.	1	1		1																						128	8	139	3	0	0	4.515625	16.0	28	24	8	7	4	13	67	7.9	8.06	7.64	20	7.2	8.59	7.0	9.2	174
4412	6809	3	In the story, the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged.

The terrain was now short, rolling hills, which would make it harder on the cyclist to pedal up the hills, for it would take a lot more effort and energy. Also, there were roadblocks, “at some point, tumbleweeds blocked my path and a ridiculously large snake “These roadblock would danger the biker, for he’d have to manever around them, losing time and energy, resulting in drinking more water. No water is a great danger for it was June, a hot day and he is risking getting dehydrated.

I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty. There was eventually nothing. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, “a large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved.	3	2		3																						156	11	172	2	0	0	4.333333333333333	14.181818181818182	31	28	12	9	5	22	87	6.1	6.55	6.87	14	5.3	6.71	5.75	7.3	199

This makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated. The cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight. If anything happened to him there is no one to help. The cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy. With very little water it is hard to stay hydrated.

His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped.

The first and most obvious is the temperature, it is hot, therefore the rider is hot and becoming dehydrated making him thirsty. A second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him. Since nothing is around him there is no where for him to get water adding to the affect of dehydration making him more thiristy. The rider says “One ran shacle shed, sevral rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn’t hold the lamestmal egreeted me. ''This statement from the author support the factt that nothing is around. Onemore feature of the setting that affected the rider was the hills.

Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (kurmaskie). the cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy, than flat riding. This energy, loss coupled with the cyclist lack of water causes him to become even more miserable.

As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, as is the sand. There is no water anywhere and dangerous, highly venomous creatures are abundant. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grope juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere.

The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would remind the body of its thirst.

He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more.” I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldn’t find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit”, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																						180	8	203	14	0	0	4.344444444444444	22.5	39	29	14	11	10	28	97	10.3	7.43	7.82	21	8.5	10.56	13.75	9.5	233
4567	6965	3	The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time. Destined to reach yosemite national park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening strongly. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture. next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted”. With what I believed to be my last burst of enery, I manevuered down the hill”. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replerilshed with confidence he had before when he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile”	3	2		3																						161	8	177	10	0	0	4.795031055900621	20.125	39	27	13	9	3	22	82	11.2	9.86	8.56	31	8.8	11.77	12.2	11.0	230
4568	6966	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned. The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him. And he was cycling with very little water.	1	1		1																						49	4	53	0	0	0	4.061224489795919	12.25	11	6	3	1	3	4	30	3.8	4.92	6.5	5	4.5	6.55	5.625	7.2	62
4570	6968	3	The author’s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist’s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he’s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person’s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.	3	2		3																						175	10	188	3	0	0	4.64	17.5	45	26	19	3	3	16	89	9.2	8.93	7.3	17	7.8	8.83	8.5	9.4	241
4571	6969	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. Fem the ghost town to the bait shop, it was all a challenge for him. A misleading challenge , But a challenge . In the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself. From staring at the horizon to get to a place to another from sucking on pebble stone to not focus on water. And when he arrive at the bait shop. A sense of relief came to him, like that shop was his safe haven. But yet he would never get directions from any old-timer again. Lack was not a factor in this story. Rather it was drive and overal climate of the story. When it was two –hundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light. And also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it.	2	2		2																						151	12	168	5	0	0	4.099337748344371	12.583333333333334	34	18	7	6	7	16	92	4.3	5.21	6.9	18	4.6	6.03	5.875	7.2	193
4574	6972	3	Almost all the features of the settin affect the cyclist. For instence the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is. “The water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips. Wid rings of sweet circled my shirt.” These description suggests that he is very hot since he is sweety and hes been drinking so much. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town. “I began breaking the ride down into distress I could make it test for.” He is making the ride seem like a lot of short rides so he could make it.	2	2		2																						133	9	141	0	0	0	4.052631578947368	14.777777777777779	30	22	7	7	3	13	77	10.9	6.1	7.92	16	10.1	11.54	10.8	8.2	167
4585	6983	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough, uneven and he has to push out more energy to pedal his bike on rough, uneven roads then on nice, paved, even roads and also he is out of water so there again is using all his energy without any redaveanator.	1	1		1																						54	1	59	4	0	0	4.2592592592592595	54.0	11	5	7	4	2	4	34	25.6	7.79	9.53	8	22.0	23.08	30.0	0.0	73
4590	6988	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist is affected by the setting mently and physicly. For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don’t think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way	2	2		2																						163	8	171	1	0	0	4.245398773006135	20.375	30	27	6	9	7	15	95	10.2	7.26	7.02	15	8.8	11.04	11.2	9.6	213
4592	6990	3	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such a empty terran that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strenght to go on and get to safty.	1	1		1																						77	3	81	1	0	0	3.8181818181818183	25.666666666666668	14	12	3	2	4	4	56	9.4	4.88	7.17	7	9.8	10.8	13.5	7.8	97
4596	6994	3	In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated “I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1”. Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages “A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen.	1	1		1																						73	3	75	0	0	0	4.602739726027397	24.333333333333332	18	10	2	6	1	6	40	12.4	9.41	8.3	16	11.6	13.01	14.833333333333334	12.5	109
4599	6997	3	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist’s mood and energy. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself.	2	2		2																						83	6	93	5	0	0	4.63855421686747	13.833333333333334	23	10	8	4	5	15	41	8.7	8.47	8.65	13	7.4	10.5	10.1	10.8	119
4601	6999	3	All the features of the settings affect his rythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can. Instead of thinking about it.

4606	7004	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way.	2	1		2																						83	8	98	7	0	0	4.795180722891566	10.375	26	14	4	5	1	14	45	6.4	7.98	7.58	14	5.0	7.05	5.0625	8.5	119
4609	7007	3	"The setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome. The author makes a mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by @LOCATION2 standards, where it gets to @NUM1 degrees, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at @NUM2. By noon, it's past @NUM3. Also, the author comes to a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 he makes note that he’s only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last ""tentalizing sips,"" This is his main problem, his lack of water.

4616	7014	3	The setting of “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of louage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there. “I got down on my hands, and knees, working,the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength.

4618	7016	3	"The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because it’s a dry area in California in June.

4621	7019	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man’s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	1	2		2																						86	6	91	0	0	0	4.3023255813953485	14.333333333333334	17	10	6	1	6	7	52	6.0	6.72	6.55	9	6.5	8.05	7.666666666666666	10.1	118
4633	7031	3	The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectaculiar and amazing like. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasn’t what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story.	1	1		1																						139	6	147	2	0	0	3.9280575539568345	23.166666666666668	15	31	3	8	9	10	87	14.5	5.76	7.86	13	13.3	14.78	13.75	9.5	175
4635	7033	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the @LOCATION1, where it’s nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. He’s excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch’s Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again.	2	3		3																						142	9	161	10	0	0	4.190140845070423	15.777777777777779	30	20	16	10	8	21	80	6.2	5.91	7.87	19	5.9	7.17	7.0	8.2	183
4638	7036	3	During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasn’t even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low. Then , what is originally a sign of hope because another let down. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach “rough roads” creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait “tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more.	3	3		3																						221	14	249	13	0	0	4.755656108597285	15.785714285714286	50	35	21	16	8	30	118	8.9	9.39	7.29	28	7.1	8.64	7.142857142857142	9.8	312

4644	7042	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people, and cars on his “shortcut” he was in great doubt of his survival. “I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.” He thought he wouldn’t get any water because there was nothing around him and he thought he would die of dehydration or heatstroke. “And the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke.”	2	2		2																						75	4	80	3	0	0	4.466666666666667	18.75	19	11	2	1	4	11	44	37.1	9.25	10.73	10	29.0	31.6	40.5	0.0	98
4647	7045	3	In this paragraph I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, & animals.

4655	7053	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, “A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didn’t have much to drink until the next town. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills” (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen” (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted.	3	2		3																						169	11	202	13	0	0	4.670588235294118	15.454545454545455	49	18	25	11	4	37	77	10.0	8.7	8.21	24	8.3	10.12	8.333333333333334	10.3	231
4656	7054	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn’t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn’t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn’t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn’t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn’t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don’t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better.	3	2		3																						221	7	233	5	0	0	4.153846153846154	31.571428571428573	36	40	16	17	11	16	140	13.9	7.09	7.06	12	12.1	13.0	12.5	7.4	285
4657	7055	3	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that he is going up this big hill its hot, there snakes, hes scared and tired. Almost all of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop he is determined to go up this hill. He also knows that it cant be that bad because he can just relax al the way back down.	1	1		1																						81	6	91	2	0	0	3.8395061728395063	13.5	10	11	9	9	1	7	56	3.4	3.82	7.04	6	3.8	6.39	6.416666666666667	7.8	98
4659	7057	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power.	2	2		2																						160	10	174	3	0	0	4.3602484472049685	16.1	30	27	3	10	7	13	107	8.1	7.36	6.0	11	7.9	8.62	6.571428571428571	9.7	217
4667	7065	3	The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , “like a foolish yuuth,” folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He –ans almost dehydrated and “in an ironic twist” he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we’re your best bet “ in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who “haven’t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office”	3	3		3																						144	6	161	8	0	0	4.427586206896552	24.166666666666668	39	22	11	4	4	27	67	11.6	8.42	9.23	19	9.0	10.64	8.166666666666666	8.3	185
4669	7067	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer and more difficult and dangerous way to go.

4676	7074	3	The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because, he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehygrated it's not healthy and you die from it. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down,along with the sweat.

This was difficult because the architecture needed had never before been created or even attempted in the past. A second obstacle was having to make sure the Empire State Building could withstand the stress created by the blimp. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The difficulty with this obstacle was having to refurbish the steel frame at the Empire State Building which took lots of time, work, and over sixty thousand dollars. ""The greatest obstacles to successful mooring was nature itself."" There were violent wind currents at the top of the building and the blimps were never very stable. There were many pedestrians under a moored dirigible so this was a very dangerous obstacle.

In order to solve this problem they needed to make modifications that would cost around six thousand dollars.

Another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below. The third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building.

Between the winds, problems with ancoring, risk of Fire and sharp spires, there were also legal issues that would first have to be bested.One thing the builders of the Empire State building hadn't considered was the wind current. Because the dirigibles were primarilly huge propelled balloons, the wind could push them around, and at 1,250 Feet, there isn't very much around to slow or block the wind. They also didn't think about the @CAPS1 that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very Flammable and if one was to ascend in @CAPS2, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people bellow would be doomed.More problems the architects face were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around.

9092	15042	6	The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was laden with problems ranging from natural preventions to pre-existing laws. During the time of frequent dirigible travel in the world, a German dirigible called the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey due to a complication with fire. This catastrophe revealed to the workers a problem they had previously overlooked, the fact that most foreign dirigibles were inflated with flamable hydrogen gas. The idea of a problem like the Hindenburg ocuring over one of the most densely populated cities in the world ruled out the idea. The workers of this project also overlooked the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Although the empire state building was anticipated to be the tallest building in the world, the soon to be created mast would still be too close to the millions of people in the city. After test runs had occured to try out the new mooring system it was seen that dirigibles were not even able to get close enough to the mast due to the strong winds. The idea that these same winds would blow the dirigible into another buildings spire put fear into the minds of the people. The combination of this variety of problems put an end to the idea of using a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building	4	4		4																						227	9	240	3	0	0	4.726872246696035	25.22222222222222	68	26	17	11	0	15	118	13.5	10.1	8.85	44	11.9	13.08	16.5	12.3	331

The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

Hydrogen was very flammable and builders figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a desely populated area like New York, it would be devastating. The greatest obsticle faced by the builders were the wind on top of the building that was constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currats. While the digarble were tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles.

The big problem that it faced was the wind speeds that high up in the air. At nearly @NUM1 feet in the air the wind would be whiping around even a massive, steel, docked dirigible. When New York governor, Al Smith put forth ideas to construct this mast nobody realized untill after that it was a somewhat rediculous task. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After it was ruled impossible, people started to realize that everyone was just caught up in the new modern travel idea to be down to reality."	2	1		2																						174	7	191	8	0	0	4.477011494252873	24.857142857142858	46	19	14	8	2	18	94	12.3	8.71	8.36	27	10.4	11.87	11.0	10.6	239
9221	15171	6	Al Smith was a guy who had an idea of making the world tallest building, and he didn't give up. In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building, goal height would reach 1,250 feet. He also wanted transportation to involve.The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was the lack of landing area. Al Smith thought he could add a mooring mast to the top of the building and allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers on and off.One of the greatest obstacle to let the dirigibles docked there, was the weather. The dirigibles moored in open landing fields could weigh down, where it could dangle high above pedestrians on the street. It was also an existing. law against airships, flying too low over urban areas.	2	2		2																						147	9	168	10	0	0	4.7114093959731544	16.555555555555557	45	23	6	8	5	17	76	13.3	9.93	8.83	22	10.5	12.25	15.0	12.2	209
9233	15183	6	while attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. For one thing, there wasn't a whole lot of landing room in New York City for them which ultimately made things tougher. Also, they were forced to put more work into the building by strengthening and modifying the steel frame of it to accommodate the new situation. A lot of money was spent on these new renevations, over sixty thousand dollars. This was done mainly to reduce stress on the building's frame. But overall they managed to get it all done, and make their way through these tricky obstacles.	2	2		2																						105	6	118	5	0	0	4.8	17.5	28	18	7	4	3	10	60	9.9	9.57	8.26	17	7.8	10.05	8.666666666666666	10.1	145
9240	15190	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in building a dock for dirigibles They would not be able to simply place of mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. The thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable would make the frame very unsturdy. With the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure it would have to get transmitted to eleven hundred feet, where the foundation is. The would need to make the frame stronger to with stand the stress which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. In the end the mooring mast never was made because of safety, unpredictable nature and of the law itself. It was unsafe due to the highly flammable dirigibles putting the high populated region in danger. The winds would shift to constantly and violently and be to very difficult to control the dirigible. Also, the law that airships flying too low over urban areas would have made it illegal. Ships would not be able to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Overall, there were too many obstacles that made it impossible for the engineers to build a mooring mast.	3	4		4																						197	10	213	4	0	0	4.690355329949239	19.7	45	22	19	14	5	15	113	10.5	9.46	7.9	31	8.6	10.52	11.6	11.0	279

In addition, safety was a major component when trying to construct the mooring mast. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen...and hydrogen is highly flammable."" New York is a very populated area, which means when building a mooring mast, safety must be considered into perspective. Lastly, their were restrictions on airships flying too close to cities. As it states in the excerpt, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

9262	15212	6	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced are dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it was ignited it was cause a lot of property damage. Also at 1,250 ft there is a lot of wind. The dirigible would blow around the building causing unnatural stress to the building. It would be very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	1	2		2																						75	5	80	1	0	0	4.56	15.0	23	10	3	3	1	6	38	7.5	8.11	8.17	11	8.0	10.27	8.5	11.2	110
9269	15219	6	Based on the excerpt to the dirigibles were not ever able to dock atop the Empire State building because @CAPS1 it was a question of safty. The passage reads that most dirigibles from outside the United States are fulled with hydrogen which is flamible. This caused the Hindenburg a German made vessel to burst into flames in New Jersey, and when this happened the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happend in the densly populated New York City. Also this was a question of safty because the winds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible all around.

9277	15227	6	And the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous challenges in order to add the mast to the building. They needed to consult with experts and learn all they could about how dirigibles themselves worked. It took engineers in New York and government workers all the way in Washington to piece together a plan on how to make it work. Just adding the mast would never work. Keeping it tethered by one cable would add a ton of stress to the framework, so all of the steel frame needed to be strengthened. Making the mast appealing to look at to took resources. Ultimately though, all the plans fell through. Nature had been the biggest problem. When currents are violent up in the air around the mast, which would cause the blimp the swing around dangerously. Had a ship crashed, hundreds of people in the urban New York would be crushed. The project had to be scrapped, with the mast becoming a purely decorative addition.	3	3		3																						165	11	181	5	0	0	4.642424242424243	15.0	43	28	5	9	3	15	89	7.9	8.52	8.4	30	5.6	8.42	8.5	9.3	222
9280	15230	6	Not everyone can invent new ways of transportation for the future. Al Smith learned that the hard way when he hired a team of builders to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team ran into numerous obstacles that caused problems and derailed there progress. One problem that arised was that the weight of the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame, which was only reenforced by steel. Another issue was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. The most important problem was nature. Wind made maneuvering difficult, and violent current could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban, populated areas. Although the idea of the Empire State Building being used as an airdock was innovative, it was not practical or well thought out.	4	3		4																						150	10	166	5	0	0	5.08	15.0	46	15	13	8	4	17	75	10.0	11.01	9.33	35	8.0	10.27	7.7142857142857135	11.2	229

New York City is full of buildings and there is not a lot a flat ground to land a dirigible. The builders second obstacle was that they couldn't find a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. The builders would need to make a stronger building frame so the mast could safely be on the top of the building without adding stress to the frame. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. The wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and strong at times. The back of the dirigible would move from the wind, even if it was tied to the building. The last reason was that there was a law that wouldn't allow the dirigibles to fly that low over an urban area.

Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zepplins over heavily crowded areas was safety.  The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out.  For example, some of those zepplins use hydrogen to stay a loft, and if a hydrogen filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty immenent people below would be harmed.  This project seems to present far too many obstables for these architects to overcome for docking a single blimp.	2	3		3																						178	8	200	4	0	0	4.772972972972973	23.125	44	24	16	13	3	19	95	90.7	11.98	16.9	32	71.5	74.12	11.4	0.0	263

If they did, the whole building's foundation would have to be changed. Nature was also a major reason to stop the project. The wind currant were always changing and the blimp would swirl around. Safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be over New York was to burst into flames many people would be killed.

9372	15322	6	The excerpt of The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted reveals that the architects of the Empire State faced a number of obstacles. Not only was the construction of the building now competive, but its expectations were unrealistic. The idea for such a masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects not very competitive. As the work-in-progress of the Chrysler building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested and addition of a mooring mast, to not only make the building the tallest, but to add to its purpose. The addition of a mooring mast would require a lot of planning, though. If a giant steel framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as is, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building, so the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger. Also, the architects didn't realized the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and proved a threat to the thousands of people living below.	2	2		2																						187	9	214	13	0	0	4.887700534759358	20.77777777777778	57	20	10	10	5	24	105	12.0	10.27	8.55	31	10.2	11.53	12.6	11.9	276
9377	15327	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there @CAPS1 was the actual design of the mooring and modifications that would have to be made to the building. Due to the stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible, structure of the building had to be made stronger. The mast would also have to withstand holding down the dirigible just one cable tether, which would put a lot of stress on the mast and building. Another issue faced by the builders was the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States most the used hydrogen, not helium, in the balloon, which made it more flammable and dangerous. If one ever caught on fire above New York City, it would be disastrous. Finally, there was already a law in place that airships could not fly to low over urban areas. This law made it so that it was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to, or even approach the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, most too great to overcome. When it came to trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the spire of the building.	4	3		4																						212	9	231	10	0	0	4.523584905660377	23.555555555555557	56	29	12	12	5	17	125	11.6	8.71	7.49	29	10.1	11.52	14.75	11.2	291
9379	15329	6	While planning this architectural masterpiece, builders faced many obstacles. This plan to have a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building definitely did not fulfill expectations. The first big problem was the large amounts of stress to the framework of the building when the zepplins would be moored to the top, also the amount of pull would impact the foundation as well. The second problem was the cost to modify the skyscraper to meet the needs to not stress the framework. Safety was a huge issue as well; most blimps are filled with hydrogen which is a highly flammable gas, also if it were to explode it is floating over one of the largest cities in the country. With New @CAPS1 geographical positioning the wind is very strong off the ocean, these violent air currents constantly shift directions which could cause the zepplin to crash into the building. The final obstacle was the law against airships, they could not fly to low over highly populated urban cities.	4	3		4																						170	7	183	5	0	0	4.8	24.285714285714285	47	16	16	12	0	16	93	13.3	10.39	9.11	34	10.4	13.25	11.6	11.5	238
9388	15338	6	The wind was a huge issue when building the empire state building. The building was so high off the ground that the top was not as stable. If they used dirigibles on the Empire State building it would be dangerous because the weights would be dangling high in the air over all of the pedestrians heads. That plan was not smart or safe.

Modifications to the building would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Other problems the building faced had to do with safety. Some dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable and if an accident were to happen in New York it would be disastrous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself.

9403	15353	6	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to use the building to make New York the leader in modern travel. They built a mooring mast which they planned to use to dock dirigibles. Unfortunately, there were some unexpected difficulties and this goal was never accomplished.When the architects first decided to add the mast to the Empire State Building, they realized that they would have to redesign the entire building's support structure because of the pressure that a docked dirigible would put on the building. Even after this problem was solved, there were numerous obsticles keeping the goal from being reached.The architects had failed to see many of the potential problems with the mast. Not until after the mast was built did they realized that most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium to stay afloat. Hydrogen, being highly flammable was not a risk that the builders wanted to take over the densely populated city. The architects also realized that the unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast would be too dangerous to dock a dirigible.Once these obsticles appeared, it became evident that the Empire State Building would never dock a dirigible.	3	3		3																						197	10	216	5	0	0	5.02	20.0	50	32	14	12	1	17	112	16.7	12.07	8.8	34	13.1	14.69	15.25	14.3	298
9406	15356	6	When attempting to add a mooring mask to the Empire State Building, the people who were adding it faced several impediments. Right away, the builders took the size of a dirigible into account. If there were something that large at the top of the building, the frame would be warped. To solve this problem, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars to change the original framework, to a more suitable one. Another obsticle faced by the builders of the mast, was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a drigible attempting to dock. Also, they realized that the mast was above a large urban area, so if there would be an accident, bad situations would take place. There was also a law about aircraft traveling too low over a City. The drigible mooring dock atop the Empire State Building was not meant to be.	3	3		3																						150	8	167	9	0	0	4.586666666666667	18.75	35	20	11	7	1	18	86	9.6	8.65	7.2	17	8.3	9.92	11.8	10.7	204

He came up with the idea that a mooring mast being added to the Empire State building would allow dirigibles to anchor there, fuel up and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible. The architects and builders had to consult with experts so they took workers at the @ORGANIZATION2, tested the mass and met with president of a recently formed airship transport company.

Upon carrying out the idea to place a mooring mast atop the thousand foot building, problems quickly presented themselves The first problem architecs ran into was the construction of the building itself. The empire state building was never built to be able to hold a thousand-foot dirigible. The added weight would stress the frame of the building. As a solution to this issue, Al Smith, the four term governor of New York, put a ""quick fix"" in place. Smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the buildings support. Even with the strengthened frame, safety was still a main conflict that put the idea to rest. Along with the structural danger, hydrogen was a main source of weight reduction for dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable was the Idea worth putting thousands of lives at stake through the dirigible blowing up? The people of New York did not wish to relive the Hindenburg fiasco right over their heads. The last major conflict in Smith's idea was nature itself.

However, the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would cause a large amount of stress to the building's frame. The builders of the Empire State building were faced with producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's framework.

Al Smith, four-term governor of New York, planned to construct the Empire State Building after he was in office.Smith was competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the title of world's tallest building. So in 1929 he announced that the building would be 1,250 feet and he would do this by adding a top or hat to the building which would be distinctive. The idea was to add a mooring mass and observation decks to the top and have it be able to dock dirigibles, or blimps. Architects later realized that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by one cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of a dirigible's load with the pressure of wind would go all the way to the building's foundation. The plans that have builders working so hard on frame work and observation decks failed. It was not practical to dock a dirigible, it wouldn't be safe. By the late 1930s, the idea was given up on, but the Empire State Building is still open to one of the observation decks and is a very popular attraction in New York."	2	1		2																						232	10	260	7	0	0	4.55793991416309	23.3	75	24	12	7	10	22	131	13.0	8.88	8.32	29	11.0	12.91	19.0	12.1	320

The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3).

9579	15529	6	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle being to much stress on the buildings frame. The dirigible would somehow have to be connected to the frame, which was @NUM1 feet below. Another problem the builders faced was safty. The workers wanted to use hydrogen to keep the dirigibles afloat, but realized hydrogen is flamable. Other problems where nature and law. Nature's winds would complicate the dirigibles from staying still. Law stated that the dirigibles would be flying to low for urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that led to a plan failed.	3	3		3																						113	9	126	3	0	0	5.0	12.555555555555555	34	20	8	4	2	13	58	8.4	10.14	8.59	23	7.0	8.23	6.111111111111111	10.3	169
9580	15530	6	Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and @CAPS1 dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast.             It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians.       Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about @MONEY1 to fix.            Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. @CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used.             Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could because by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way.	4	4		4																						301	19	346	17	0	0	5.245901639344262	16.05263157894737	84	35	26	17	9	42	157	13.7	11.95	8.58	60	12.9	12.32	10.666666666666666	13.6	519

Architects also had to find a way to redesign the building so that it support the weight of the dirigible. The biggest obstecle, they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and although it would be tied down to the building the back of it would still be swirling, they didn't have a way to fix that, because usually dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in an open field and it would be to risky to do that over a populated area.	2	3		3																						171	7	186	6	0	0	4.5964912280701755	24.428571428571427	43	24	9	8	2	15	101	12.5	9.12	8.63	29	10.4	12.33	11.4	10.9	233

The used of hydrogen rather than helium because hydrogen is highly flammable. The obstacles of it was nature itself. There's always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building. So it makes it possible for the dirigible to swivel around which is dangerous. Dirigibles moored in the open landing fields could be weighed down but, using these at the Empire State Building can dangling high above pedestrians which is not safe. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If the dirigible blows the sharp spires of the building can puncture the dirigible's shell.

In 1937 a hydrogen blimp did catch fire, and the outcome was disastrous; owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have been much worse. In higher altitudes winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to spend about. Normally the tail end would be weighted down, but weights hanging above the city isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempt: at docking of the building the winds were too fierce for the dirigible to even get close to the building. The capitan of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2) and that could put a hole in the blimp.

Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.

Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flamable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazzard about New York City. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly dirigibles to low over urban areas.

A German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed due to a fire and once the Empire State Building noticed how much worse it could've been in a higher populated place like New York, their hopes went down a little bit. Another obstacle was one that couldnt be fixed, because it was caused by nature. It was the violent winds. The excerpt stated ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only solution was to put lead weights in the back, but then they would be hanging over pedestrians, which is definatly not safe.

In New York there was violent air currents and when the dirigibles would be tied up they would sway. The idea was to hold them in place by lead weights. This was not practical or safe. The one thing that should have been thought of before it was ever constructed was the law. It was illegal for a airship to fly low over urban areas or even to tie up to buildings. In conclusion everything should have been thought out before making hype about something that was not safe, and that was illegal."	3	3		3																						188	12	202	1	0	0	4.409574468085107	15.666666666666666	43	18	14	12	5	15	114	7.9	7.6	7.42	25	6.4	9.39	8.333333333333334	9.6	248

Also there would only be one cable holding it in place. The cable was called a tether. Another obstacle would be an existing law saying that you cant moor your ship there because you are flying to low. In December 1930 the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible tried parking there but they were affraid of the wind knocking it into another building. Therefor they went threw a few hard obstacles but in the end they fixed it and made it happen.	2	2		2																						108	7	117	0	0	0	4.62037037037037	15.428571428571429	22	17	7	6	4	8	65	8.0	8.76	8.49	19	6.9	8.38	7.571428571428571	10.0	151

These derigibles needed quick means of refueling and unloading passenger both eficiently and with safety. At the very time these derigibles became popular modern day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was heading efforts to construct the Empire State Building came up with the idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building which would help dirigibles dock, refuel and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable"" it was never put to use because of safety concerns found later by Architects. These safety concerns included fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" as well as air space restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas.""

This is a problem for the builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they would not be leagally allowed to dock dirigibles at the Mooring Mast. Lastly, many dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a feul.

The builders had to worry about the safty of the people coming in and out of the dirigible, the people on the near by streets and to the people in the side of the building. Saftey was one of the main reasons why the dock never was completed.Another huge obstacle that faced the builders was nature. This is true because winds at the top of the tall buildings were always changing and this would make it hard to land the dirigible on it. Like the excerpt states in paragraph @NUM1, Dirigibles were weighted down in the back by lead weights and this would cause a problem with pedestrians walking under in the streets.	2	3		2																						144	7	154	2	0	0	4.524137931034483	20.714285714285715	37	16	10	5	5	9	87	12.0	9.06	7.79	18	10.3	11.54	11.8	11.2	196

10056	16006	6	In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak.The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put @MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building.An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives.I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still use the mooring mast today.	2	3		3																						176	10	195	4	0	0	4.4972067039106145	17.9	64	15	11	3	2	17	94	12.7	8.94	7.57	18	9.5	11.63	11.2	10.3	235
10057	16007	6	Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for ship to even go near the building. But say a ship got tethered to the mooring mast, the back end of the ship would swivel around the mass due to constant shifting winds because of violent air currents. Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights. This was dangerous for many reasons but mainly because the weights would be hanging over downtown New York. Without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell. With the wind pressure and the dirigibles load itself there would be too much stress being added to the buildings frame. The buildings steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have to be made so the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most of the dirigibles that were made out of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is more flamable so the owners of the Empire state building realized how worse the accident could have been if it were over downtown New York. With all of these obsticles in their way the owners and builders of the Empire state building voted to postpone the installation of the landing gear.	4	4		4																						269	12	284	3	0	0	4.710037174721189	22.416666666666668	74	29	23	10	4	15	151	12.0	9.99	7.86	41	9.7	11.34	11.8	11.2	374

10121	16071	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. A big problem with safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building would not work out due to the highly populated New York and dangling over pedestrians.Another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even aproach the area. Even if it could, there was worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings.	3	3		3																						139	6	151	4	0	0	4.792857142857143	23.333333333333332	39	17	9	9	4	11	78	15.2	10.57	8.76	24	13.0	13.71	20.0	12.7	202
10124	16074	6	Based on the excerpt given, the idea for allowing dirigibles to land on a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City was not practical. One obstacle that proves this point is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen a highly flamable gas rather than helium like a balloon. This raises safety issues for the urban city. Another obstacle that prevented this idea from being practical was that certain laws were passed stating that dirigibles and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to violent winds and the risk of destruction. The mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful for tourist attraction.	3	2		3																						118	5	125	1	0	0	4.796610169491525	23.6	37	11	10	6	4	7	59	13.0	10.51	9.09	23	11.3	12.83	16.0	13.3	178

Hydrogen is highly flammable which would be very dangerous to have over a densely populated area. The ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" By this, Lüsted means that there are many violent air currents at the top of the building, meaning that the ship would swivel around and around. To make sure this would not happen, lead wieghts would have to be used which would not be practical or safe to have ""dangling high above pedestrians.""

10143	16093	6	The experts faced a few major obstacles in the building of the Empire State building.  One of those major obstacles was the frame work.  When your going to build a 1,250 foot building and have a air craft land on it, you need a good and well designed frame.  What they did was add a stainless steal and chrome-nickle windows to cut down on pressure.  They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State building.  The other main issue was the air currents.  You can not strapp a dirigible and believe the back of it swaying back and worth.  When your almost a 11 @NUM1 ft in the air, the wind can be very violent at that height.  If the dirigible ever came off or unhooked before they were done refueling, the dirigible would crash and burn, hundreds of pedestrian on the ground below.  Al Smith had a great idea but he did not realize all the problems.	2	2		2																						164	10	189	5	0	0	4.219653179190751	17.3	43	18	14	6	8	19	93	81.3	8.79	15.04	22	64.9	67.31	6.714285714285714	0.0	230

The whole building had to be strengthed to adjust to the pressure, but the workers eventually got the construction done. However, the biggest thing that hindered the mooring mast from being successful was nature itself. The winds that high in the air were constantly shifting violently, so even if the dirigible had been attached to the mast, the back of it would swivel around uncontrollably. Unfortunately because they would have landed high in the air, using lead weights the control the back of the aircraft was impractical. The prevention of natures problems is not possible, and similarly nothing could have been done to fix the issue of unsafety. Most blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 used a more flammable gas inside of them, and landing a dirigible that could catch on fire high above New York City was an extremely dangerous idea.

There was a huge saftey issue having the blimps so close to the city. In paragraph @NUM1, the fear of winds that could blow the blimp into other buildings, wrecking them, scared people. The second concern was the fact that the blimp is full of highly flamable gas and if they blimp was ever to burst into flames above a city, much damage would be done to the blimp and New York City. The last major concern is located in paragraph nine. The problem would be the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to the top of it. The whole building would have to be reconstructed to help the Empire State Building not take on that stress; In fact, basically every part of the building and blimp would have to be remodeled in order to keep New York City, and the passengers of the dirigible safe.	3	3		3																						180	7	195	7	0	0	4.361111111111111	25.714285714285715	55	22	12	5	4	15	105	12.0	7.78	7.54	19	9.8	11.84	12.75	8.8	232

Additionally, if a dirigible was tied to the mast, it would moving all around the mast based on the unpredictable air currents. However, safety was also a major factor. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted @NUM2). Therefore, attempting to tie dirigibles to the mast of the Empire State Building was very unsafe, as the obstacles the builders faced were simply too much to overcome."	3	2		3																						179	10	203	6	0	0	4.860335195530726	17.9	55	20	12	16	1	21	94	14.2	10.28	8.52	26	10.9	12.7	14.5	12.5	258
10213	16163	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem was designing the building to be able to withstand the stress from a thousand-foot dirigible swinging around it in the wind. The builders needed to find a way to distribute the wind pressure all the way to the foundation. Another problem was the strong winds surrounding the building; when the navy tried to dock a dirigible on it, it kept being tossed about by the strong winds, this problem was never solved. A third problem was finding a way to actually dock the dirigible, this was quickly solved with a winch. A final problem was the fact that the dirigibles were so dangerous, and couldnt safly dock, as well as a law that prevented dirigibles from flying close to buildings, which was created for that reason.	3	3		3																						146	6	162	6	0	0	4.705479452054795	24.333333333333332	34	23	9	8	1	15	78	12.9	9.75	8.09	22	10.4	12.19	11.8	12.5	210
10214	16164	6	During this time period, dirigibles were seen as the transportation of the future, and everybody thought that this was plausible. There were problems, however, that nobody saw through. For example, the dirigibles were seen to be the next big thing in transportation, but there was no evidence to support this. They spent all of their time, effort, and resources to construct something for a purpose that never worked. There were other problems that were overlooked as well, such as the wind speed at that height, and even if they could get close enough to the mast, they would need someone to stand on the very top and tie it down, which would be too hard for one person. As the excerpt shows, Al Smith and his architects jumped into this problem too quickly and with insufficient information.	2	1		2																						137	6	156	13	0	0	4.795620437956204	22.833333333333332	28	18	8	10	7	19	89	12.6	10.04	7.53	19	9.8	11.75	12.0	11.5	187
10217	16167	6	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first major problem was they weren't sure if the structure of the building could hold up to a swaying dirigible. As said in paragraph @NUM1. Also the builders knew that since the dirigible would be hooked to the mast by a single cable, the air currents would make the back of the ship swivel around the mooring mast. As said in paragraph @NUM2.  There also was a law enforcement against airships flying too lower over urban areas. That would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. Those are some of the obstacles that the builders were faced with	2	3		3																						124	8	134	1	0	0	4.512	15.625	31	15	9	5	0	9	74	8.8	8.23	7.83	21	7.8	9.02	8.333333333333334	9.2	168
10218	16168	6	The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest building in the World. Al Smith's plans were to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building, but when a @NUM1-foot tall spire was added to the top, the Empire State Building was going to come in second. To overcome this first obstace in building the tower, Smith decided to change the idea for the tower and add his own spire: a mooring mast for dirigibles. Using the tower as an anchor for dirigible balloons, or zeppelins, Smith added another 250 feet to the tower. But to continue with the plan, Smith had to face the obstacle of supporting a floating blimp more than @NUM2 feet above the ground. Smith had the entire building frame modified and strengthened before the building was finished. Smith's final obstacle was one he couldn't control: the weather. The winds at the top of the building were too harsh, so the dirigible idea was scrapped, but Al Smith's tower had made it to the world's tallest building.	2	2		2																						172	8	197	8	0	0	4.6686046511627906	21.5	55	24	15	1	6	21	93	11.3	8.94	8.28	22	8.1	10.23	11.0	9.5	231

Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be supplied, and would also prove to be hazardous.

Finally, the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a small area.

10228	16178	6	It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire state Building. The first reason's that, the law against flying airships to low over the Empire State Building made it hard to do so. Next is that the thoughtes in being unsafe because some dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is flammable A big reason is when the german dirigible got destryed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building then realized how much more worse the accident could have been if it had happened on such a densely populated area suched as downtown New York City. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe. It was clear that there were problems in the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State building; but it is probably a much safer choice for both the residents/citizens of New York and all of the people who ever work(ed) on it such as architects, engineers and the aviation pioners.	3	3		3																						187	5	203	5	0	0	4.625668449197861	37.4	52	18	14	11	7	16	108	19.1	9.64	8.62	29	15.5	17.95	19.333333333333332	14.3	267

The architects knew that the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (par. @NUM1).

First, it would be difficult to build a suitable landing area. As described in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, a dirigible held by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened so that the added stress would be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Also, safety is a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM2, it stated that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""

10368	16318	6	In the 1920s, dirigibles were considered to be the future of transportation. Although useful, dirigibles had an issue, there was not enough landing area in New York City. With this in mind, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building, he would construct a mooring mast on the top of the building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, refuel, and also allow passengers go on and off. Adding a mooring mast seemed full proof at the time but this new construction plan endured on many obstacles.The first obstacle was how to add a mooring mast without adding stress to the building's frame. Architects detected that the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This led to the second obstacle which was modifying and strengthening the the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the first obstacle. Finally the third obstacle, which was the expense. Modifying the building's new frame work would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Consequently, Al Smith saw a great oppertunity for the Empire State Building but he was faced with many obstacles.	3	3		3																						202	11	228	9	0	0	4.985294117647059	18.545454545454547	69	25	13	8	6	21	111	13.5	11.55	8.11	32	10.8	12.72	12.4	13.2	305

Of course, there are several reasons as to why this plan didn't come to fruition. First of all, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which would make it impossible to tie a dirigible to a building legally. Also, the high powered air currents atop the building would cause a docked dirigible to sway uncontrollably, making it a safety hazard. Finally, many non-U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen to fly instead of helium, and if a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous for civilians.

Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. If an accident, such as fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as New York City. Another factor affecting building was nature. The winds above were constantly shifting due to currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging above a city of people. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low in urban areas.

10441	16391	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the mooring mast had to face obstacles that hindered the success of the docking of the dirigibles. First, the architects had to design the mast. They knew that the frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened to carry the load and wind pressure of the dirigible. Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton"" and planned for the reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan to follow through. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" proving that the mooring mast was unsafe and could lead to potential accidents. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Showing the physical insecurity of the ship on the dirigible. Lastly, the law states restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Even though builders wanted to provide a launching pad for the dirigibles and had an ideal design, there were too many faults that made the mooring mast impossible to bring to reality. Clearly, the builders faced many problems that could not have been solved in trying to allow the dirigibles to dock"	4	4		4																						249	12	281	12	0	0	5.056224899598393	20.75	71	38	17	13	9	27	133	13.7	11.55	8.82	54	10.9	12.41	11.6	12.6	371
10454	16404	6	The idea of making the top of the Empire State Building into a dirigible @CAPS1 had been a good idea, and would have helped with the problem of there was no area large enough for the dirigible to land. However there were flaws in the idea that were not discovered till the construction of the building was completed. One flaw was the violent air currents that would keep the winds around the building constantly moving and would the move back of the dirigible around and around till eventuly the back of the dirigible would hit the building. The other flaw Was that most of the dirigibles was filled with a highly flamable gas known as hydrogen. If the dirigible had exploded and burst into flames like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 then the flaming shell would fall down on the people around the building. Even if the flaws had been fixed, there was already a law that went against the airships flying too low over urban areas and if the airships managed to land on the Empire States Building it would be considered illegal.	3	3		3																						189	6	199	4	0	0	4.560846560846561	31.5	45	22	11	13	5	12	112	15.8	9.41	8.29	27	13.2	15.35	15.25	13.0	260

Another obstacle would have to be that the builders didn't check the laws of the city because an aircraft can fly that low over urban areas such as New York City so this law prevented and made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with public safety and this was the greatest reason. This project with the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York city it would be catastrophic! For example the German dirigible the Hindenburg did in lakehurst, New Jersey then the accident would be much worse & many people would die.	3	3		3																						165	6	173	1	1	0	4.5636363636363635	27.5	47	18	14	8	4	7	91	13.9	9.35	8.26	26	11.6	14.09	15.0	12.7	234

For example, after the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the fear of such an accident occurring in a densely populated areas such as New York posed a problem, because most international dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Another obstacle was the nature of the mooring mast, and the violent air currents that cause shifts in wind.

For example, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen, rather than helium, gas. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Therefore, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937.

Furthermore, anchoring a @NUM1 foot dirigible to the top of a building with a single tether would add stress to the building's frame.

Additionally, there are violent & unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot had to maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible.

10465	16415	6	Al Smith and his group of architects encountered many problems when they attempted to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in order to dock dirigibles. Before they began building, the architects realized that they could not land a dirigible on the buildings flat roof. They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Although the architects had a great idea, they never realized why it would not work until after building.	4	4		4																						234	10	256	10	0	0	5.042735042735043	23.4	66	34	15	10	4	20	124	14.0	11.73	8.1	38	11.2	11.92	15.5	13.3	361
10466	16416	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. For one, most drigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so it could explode. For instance, on May 6, 1937 the German drigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. There is no predicting that that could never happen again. The greatest obstacle in attempting drigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and even if it was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Drigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets wasn't practical and not safe. Another reason is because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, due to fear over the wind, blowing the drigible in to other buildings in the area which would puncture the drigible's shell and cause a lot of damage.	3	4		4																						203	8	224	11	0	0	4.822660098522167	25.375	55	25	14	10	5	22	116	14.0	10.39	8.86	40	10.8	12.92	10.833333333333334	12.4	287
10468	16418	6	When something is getting invented or built, many obstacles are faced. The number one obstacle was safety. The wind at the top of the empire state building was another problem. The actual building was a problem too. All these problems and the architects tried to work around them, and failed.Safety is important, if one person dies per trip nobody is going to go on the ballon. Safety is important, no safety means no bussiniss. The wind was a huge problem. If the balloon won't stay still while unloading it is very unsafe. The skeleton of the building would have to change and that is an expensive fix. These are some of the major obstacles the architects faced. Maybe one day they will fix it.	2	2		2																						124	12	142	4	0	0	4.584	10.416666666666666	30	16	8	4	4	13	73	6.0	7.52	6.36	13	5.3	6.78	5.666666666666667	9.3	172
10471	16421	6	There were many obstacles that stood in the way of the of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The layout of how the mast would be used was not carefully thought out. One reason is because must dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Due to the fact the dirigible would be relatively in close proximity with the pedestrians and other buildings, it would be unwise to use the mast. In addition there was an existing law stating that the dirigible could not fly low in urban areas, which it would do just that if it attached to the mast. Also, the force of the wind could spin the back of the dirigible, causing it to go around and around the mast. The solution would be to put heavy blocks in the back that could cause it to fall on top of the pedestrians. Overall, there were many reasons why it was unreasonable to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																						161	8	175	6	0	0	4.459627329192546	20.125	31	23	10	11	2	11	106	9.6	8.07	7.38	25	8.8	11.52	12.8	11.9	224

The building was originally planned to also function as a Mooring mast for dirigibles. Unfortunately many problems lay in the way interning this theory into reality. One obstacle the constructors of the Empire State Building faced was the use of dangerous gases in the balloons. ""Most Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. ""The use of hydrogen posed a dangerous threat to the safty of civilians in New York City.

(the dirigibles) dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. A third problem the builders had was the leaglity of the issue of mooring ships the buildings. There was an existing law against air ships flying to low over urban areas. ""With this law in place it would have been impossible for ships to moor.

10476	16426	6	Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task, creating this futureistic design carried alot of problems beside it. Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there were also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York.Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg. But and accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical. Because of these problems and more, the thought of using a Mooring Mast to dock Dirigibles was quitely retired.	3	3		3																						212	8	229	7	0	0	4.699530516431925	26.625	47	28	18	15	13	16	122	15.9	10.28	8.42	36	12.7	14.2	28.5	12.5	304

This shows that in order for the dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building, there must be enough landing space. If a mooring mast was added to the top of the building it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. One of the others practical reason why dirigibles could not moore at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The architects could also not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, could add stress to the building's frame.

Another issue was the landing of the dirigibles themselves. They could be weighed down when on flat land but not on top of a building there would be many people below who could be injured if something went wrong.

The task of the building something on the Empire State Building that would allow dirigibles to dock there was a daring and dangerous job.There were many obstacles the builders faced. One obstacle was the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make building very difficult because everything would get blown around. Another obstacle was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" That means the builders first had to make the building strong enough to hold the docking place before they could start building the docking place.These two obstacles that the builders faced made building the docking place much harder. It took much longer because they first had to make the frame of the building stronger. Also they had to watch the wind so that they would not get hurt."	3	2		3																						176	11	197	1	0	0	4.910614525139665	16.272727272727273	48	29	9	11	2	14	103	13.1	11.08	7.15	21	9.5	10.85	12.2	11.0	242
