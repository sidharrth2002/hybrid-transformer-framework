5994	9550	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is Finally comfortable with her new “home.” After the passage is mostly a reflection of Saeng’s old life, it ends this way to signify that she has become accustomed to her new way of life. For example, it says “in the spring, and the geese return…” that shows that she is now used to the geese and the nature of her new world. The author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release. Saeng had so many memories locked inside her old life, that she couldn’t grasp new ones in her new home. The authors use of this paragraph is a good way to close out the story because it lets the reader feel the relaxed scene of the birds flying away; Saeng escaping  her pain and becoming  a real part of her new world.	2	3		3																						153	5	166	4	0	0	4.108974358974359	31.2	39	22	16	6	3	16	81	13.6	7.09	8.15	16	11.7	14.07	14.25	10.8	197
6005	9561	4	In “Winter Hibiscus,” by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. “…in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words.	2	2		2																						101	5	114	9	0	0	4.352941176470588	20.4	25	16	9	4	3	18	58	11.9	7.67	8.02	13	9.6	11.31	13.75	9.5	132
6014	9570	4	The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that.	2	2		2																						116	4	121	1	0	0	3.9741379310344827	29.0	17	23	2	6	7	6	76	11.8	6.11	6.57	5	8.7	11.94	17.0	6.0	131

The author ended the story with this excerpt, ”When they come back, ‘Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The reason for this is so she will have time to adjust. Saeng just needs a little comforting because all of this is new to her. This words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself, “Almost familiar to her now. Like geese."""	2	1		2																						94	6	106	6	0	0	4.574468085106383	15.666666666666666	21	12	7	6	2	18	52	11.8	8.77	7.49	11	10.1	11.53	13.25	10.1	127

The way she speaks of the test shows her determination.

The author shows that Saeng will relate to the blooms or the hybiscus plant and take the test again. The author does this to leave a clif haber and it shows there is more to Saeng’s life but it is still to come. In the story Saeng is trys to get used to change and that she is have a hard time.

6052	9608	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng , was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,’’ I think Saeng’s mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng Its almost as if she’s saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change likes anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try hander to pass it next time. Saeng  isn’t going to give up and she’ll keep holding on to make it through Saeng knows it’s hard to adjust to changes to life’s but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, she’ll be able to get situated in this new place.	2	3		3																						156	5	169	10	0	0	4.2993630573248405	31.4	33	29	11	10	8	23	85	18.4	8.02	8.52	13	13.7	16.29	26.0	8.1	190
6055	9611	4	The Hibiscus is budding means that the flower was growing. That is a flower with lots of bright colors and nothing else can beat it. The reason another flower can’t beat it is because that flower represents so much thing and it is one of the most natural born flowers around.	1	1		1																						51	3	54	0	0	0	4.411764705882353	17.0	10	7	3	5	2	4	31	7.8	7.65	7.27	7	7.6	9.15	8.833333333333334	9.7	70

However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."	2	2		2																						178	9	196	10	0	0	4.550561797752809	19.77777777777778	47	31	12	10	4	25	97	9.9	8.41	7.81	23	8.7	10.17	10.333333333333334	10.7	243
6062	9618	4	The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driver’s test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, “aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. “Through the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. “The pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered,”, “The winter hibiscus’ was in the ground now”, and, “overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and – yes – Familiar to Saeng now.” This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saeng’s newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to thrive in it.	3	3		3																						237	12	254	9	0	0	4.30801687763713	19.75	58	25	22	15	9	27	123	15.8	7.85	7.92	26	13.0	15.25	18.0	11.5	299
6066	9622	4	The  last  paragraph of the story.” Winter Hibiscus by Minfong  Ho is important to the story. The last paragraph leaves a definite ending so the  reader  knows  exactly what is going to happen  in the future.  This  paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represent s symbols in the story. The author concludes the hibiscus is important to her. Along with the hibiscus it also shows that the  geese  and the melting of the snow represent a fresh  start  and a new  beginning . These symbols  are  important  to her in that they  give  her a chance to start over and she sees that in the  winter  hibiscus.	2	2		2																						112	6	138	0	0	0	3.887218045112782	22.166666666666668	27	11	11	3	3	8	64	10.7	8.3	7.01	11	11.9	10.68	10.333333333333334	12.3	183

6069	9625	4	"I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says,”when the snows melt and the geese return” this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, “when this hibiscus is budding,""  and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam.  Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement."	3	2		3																						150	6	168	10	0	0	4.342105263157895	25.333333333333332	34	23	6	10	6	18	88	14.2	8.08	7.44	15	11.5	13.33	11.2	10.4	195

6110	9666	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because everything in the story will repeat such as the season changes and you will not be able to plant nor grow in the winter. For example she talked about how the plants are nothing like her home, but she has to adapt to the fact she’s not home, & adjust to her environment. I say this because if she doesnt she will just be an unhappen person worrying about where she came from.	1	1		1																						82	3	88	2	0	0	4.2926829268292686	27.333333333333332	13	12	3	3	4	6	54	12.6	7.78	7.51	8	10.3	12.78	15.333333333333334	10.5	107

6114	9670	4	This was a very interesting story and it snowed all the hardships this young girl has gone through, the author ended it in a very interesting way. When they ended the story I thought to myself how nice it ended. If think the author did a very nice job. She made it so that she snowed all the hard ships that Saeng had gone through, as if they were the harsh winter. Then as the author said, “as the snow melts away;…”,I think this shows how even though Saeng  problems seem never ending and harsh, that one day they will be gone and things will become beautiful again, like the flower budding. In the spring time. Also she did a nice job because throughout the story I could feel her pain. I felt as if I was there with her because of her use of descriptive  words like, “exploding, shock ,intense” and others to describe how much of a sudden was everything was. Then when she ended it, it was like she was showing us Saeng’s hope for a better future, even though things aren’t the way they were back home!	2	3		3																						192	9	215	11	1	0	4.184615384615385	21.666666666666668	34	28	14	16	4	26	117	9.2	6.67	6.5	11	6.9	8.94	10.4	7.8	237

6125	9682	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind because she found  a  flower that reminds her of homeland. She is afraid that her parents  are going to be mad at for not passing the test, therefore she  buys  a  flower  that she sees for it remind. When she gets home and telling her mom how much she paid for the flower  and  how  she  didn’t  pass, mother is upset for only a second, then she is understanding of what her  daughter is going throgh.

6127	9684	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again. The author wants to tell the reader because she fail the test she know what she did wrong and shes going to correct. For example when Saeng said, “then I will take that test again.” Saeng feel sorry she fail a simple test so she wants to retake the test when the snow melts.	1	1		1																						75	5	80	1	0	0	4.1866666666666665	15.0	18	17	2	2	1	7	39	10.8	6.91	6.56	4	8.3	10.53	12.833333333333334	6.4	91
6133	9690	4	Why I think the auther concludes the last paragraph in the story because it's kind of like a moral to the story.

6138	9695	4	The Author ends the story off with that paragraph because when dealing with flowers and nature. Then are seasons  when the flowers don’t  come up like winter for example. The paragraph is saying in the spring when the winter is over she tells her self that she will look forward to seeing all the plant that nature has to give.	0	0		0																						60	3	65	0	0	0	4.32258064516129	20.666666666666668	15	10	0	2	1	5	35	9.4	8.12	7.52	7	7.6	8.67	10.333333333333334	6.4	80
6142	9699	4	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. This is done to symbolize the many things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were “strange before [and] had become familiar to her now”. The hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed. The last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learnt.	2	2		2																						130	6	147	9	0	0	4.7153846153846155	21.666666666666668	31	23	9	2	7	19	75	10.1	9.28	7.6	19	8.2	10.52	10.166666666666666	11.2	180
6165	9722	4	The auther concluded the story with this because just like the flower it will come back a new, and so will she. The flower represents determination, using the flower to show her own determination. Even though she failed her drivers test she still has determination to take it, and try to pass again. Even with failur she is determained to get over it. Just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back. Saeng is frogeting her failure and coming back a new.	2	2		2																						87	6	96	3	0	0	4.517241379310345	14.5	15	17	3	10	4	14	56	7.1	7.71	7.08	12	6.6	8.1	7.416666666666666	9.3	122
6167	9724	4	In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment.	2	3		3																						168	8	176	0	0	0	4.208333333333333	21.0	45	30	7	5	3	15	94	10.4	7.09	7.83	16	7.9	11.03	13.5	8.4	209
6168	9725	4	The author puts that excerpt into the text to show the reader that she had made a mistake an will fix it in the future. I believe the other put it in  for that reason because in the text Saeng began to cry when she admitted to her mother that she failed the test. This shows that she was really upset by the fact she failed an hopes to improve in the near future. Another reason why I believe ‘the author concludes the story like this is to lead the reader on to believe Saeng is going to get over beign home sick.	1	1		1																						103	4	108	0	0	0	3.9615384615384617	26.0	21	20	3	1	0	7	62	10.2	5.93	6.6	4	9.8	10.71	13.25	8.1	133
6171	9728	4	There is why the author ended the story with this paragraph. It mean that when she comes back after winter she will repeat her tasks all over. For example she will dig, sen flowers, their customers. Then when winter comes again she will do it all over. So has steally the other is using different words to say when winter ends she will repeat her actions. That is why the author ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																						77	6	85	2	0	0	4.402597402597403	12.833333333333334	16	13	2	9	0	7	50	5.7	6.77	6.94	8	4.7	5.64	5.75	6.4	101
6174	9731	4	I think that the author ends this story with that paragraph to some up what the story was all about and to also say that Saeng would try the test again. In the story it says “she realised that many of the thing that she had thought of as strange before had become, though the quiet repetition of season opon reason, almost familiar to her now and this last paragraph help bring all this together.	1	2		2																						75	2	79	2	0	0	4.293333333333333	37.5	14	9	5	8	2	7	50	17.5	7.9	7.18	4	14.4	16.07	20.25	0.0	96
6177	9734	4	She failed the test at the same day that she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her. The plant represents her home, where she used to live and the geese could represent how they are moving on in life, over coming the obstacles of cold weather, and snow to move on to something better most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her. So she wanted to take it again, around the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels thot since she failed, she should start over.	2	2		2																						116	6	128	5	0	0	4.112068965517241	19.333333333333332	18	19	8	9	5	10	72	7.6	5.98	6.23	7	6.1	8.75	11.2	8.8	138
6179	9736	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting.	0	0		0																						84	2	92	7	0	0	4.488095238095238	42.0	18	15	4	6	3	11	46	20.7	9.01	8.54	9	15.0	17.75	22.5	0.0	104
6184	9741	4	The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over, she will start over too. In the essay Saeng, the young girl says, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” @CAPS1 Saeng failed the test the first time, She is going to wait until spring so that she can have a fresh start. In the essay, the “winter hibiscus” reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in @LOCATION1. This at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time. Her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her driver’s test again in the spring.	2	3		3																						164	7	178	8	0	0	4.347560975609756	23.428571428571427	36	26	10	10	7	20	95	12.7	7.61	7.21	12	9.2	12.14	17.333333333333332	10.1	201

6194	9751	4	I think the author adds the last paragraph because the story could use a little part about Saeng. And what she is planning to do next. Also the author @MONTH1 have added that paragraph because she was maybe thinking about writing a second story of winter Hibiscus, and they wanted to write a part that could be about in the next story. It would make you wonder that if she does take the test again would she pass it this time after the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. I think this @MONTH1 be why the author added this paragraph in the story.	1	1		1																						107	5	114	2	0	0	4.308411214953271	21.4	23	17	5	4	3	7	68	9.6	7.2	6.32	7	8.1	8.93	10.4	6.7	137
6195	9752	4	I think the author concluded the Story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First, when saeng first saw the hibiscus, she was sad, but after seeing the flower, she got happy. Next, her mother helps her plant it and saeng is sure it'll be there in spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since she has reflected on her past	1	1		1																						60	4	70	6	0	0	4.583333333333333	15.0	12	10	4	7	2	10	33	7.6	7.76	6.75	4	5.6	8.67	7.75	9.5	79
6206	9763	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter the hibiscuses are dying. Also she is leaving and wont come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, and she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																						68	4	74	1	0	0	4.382352941176471	17.0	14	9	0	8	2	6	43	7.7	7.42	6.57	6	6.4	8.56	8.25	8.1	89
6207	9764	4	The reason the author of “Winter hibiscus” ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end  of a moderatly depressing story. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving foreward.  And that the end of your world comes when you make it so. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end.	2	1		2																						79	5	86	0	0	0	3.888888888888889	16.2	17	12	5	4	1	8	50	7.1	5.34	6.42	6	7.5	9.44	7.699999999999999	8.8	101

6221	9778	4	The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower. It’s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus.	1	1		1																						35	2	37	0	0	0	4.2	17.5	8	7	1	3	2	4	20	7.4	7.02	7.73	3	6.4	7.98	8.25	0.0	43
6229	9786	4	The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and relizes what it symbolizes to her. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscas herself so that she holds the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this manner.	1	1		1																						65	4	69	0	0	0	4.415384615384616	16.25	12	13	0	3	1	7	40	10.2	7.95	8.36	11	9.4	11.76	13.166666666666666	11.9	91

6241	9798	4	The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a vowe to herself because it shows how important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her determination because it reminds her of home. Saeng says “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The hibiscus flower gives her confidence. It reminds her of her home in Vietnam before they moved to @LOCATION2. Therefore, the author concludes the story with that certain paragraph because it symbolizes the importance of the flower.	2	1		2																						93	6	102	3	0	0	4.829787234042553	15.666666666666666	28	13	2	2	1	13	50	10.8	10.33	8.12	14	9.4	10.45	11.5	11.6	141
6259	9816	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says “In the spring when the snows melt” because she is beginning to get used to “the quiet repetition of season upon season”. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.	2	2		2																						118	6	126	3	0	0	4.61864406779661	19.666666666666668	28	17	11	1	2	14	66	12.1	9.35	7.35	12	10.1	12.49	12.0	12.3	166
6265	9822	4	In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driving test again in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings to her. She describes peaceful things in nature, like the geese and hibiscus, that she draws strength from because they remind her to her homeland. In this way, she’ll always have a little piece of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng relates to nature and pulls strength from it. Her mother has a garden, and she relates to it in that she has a different past, preferring natural foods like bitter melons over @LOCATION1. This final paragraph shows the hope that the beautiful nature from her homeland has brought to Saeng, helping her adapt to living in a new place.	2	3		3																						139	7	154	8	0	0	4.618705035971223	19.857142857142858	35	21	10	2	3	15	77	10.3	8.82	7.58	15	7.5	9.11	7.5	8.4	183

6277	9834	4	I think Saeng need to take the test over because to get her grade up. Saeng be waring about the snow, in the spirng because she is think about the flower getting cover over it.

6278	9835	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she’s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she’s not giving up “…then I will take that teat again” which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																						72	4	77	0	0	0	4.315068493150685	18.25	18	14	1	3	0	8	40	8.2	7.48	6.72	7	6.8	8.31	8.5	7.2	91

IN THE PHRASE, ""WHEN THEY COME BACK"" THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY REFERS TO THE HIBISCUS FLOWERS THAT REPRESENT THE FOND MEMORIES OF HER HOMELAND. THE AUTHOR ILLUSTRATES SAENG'S STRUGGLE ADAPTING TO HER NEW LIFE THROUGH A “TEST” OF PLANTING THE BUDS JUST AS SHE HAD DONE BACK HOME WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. THIS TEST REPRESENTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ADAPTATION TO HER NEW LIFE.

6290	9847	4	The author decided to conclude the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new life. In the third paragraph on the second page the author writes, “Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile… That atleast, she could hold onto.” After failing her driver’s test Saeng was feeling foreign and alone. She desperately looked to the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned. After a discussion with her mother Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings. By concluding the story, with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must “blossom” in her new home in order to do well. She still needs time for this, as the flowers needs time to plant its roots into the ground.	3	3		3																						162	7	179	9	0	0	4.638036809815951	23.285714285714285	41	24	11	8	3	23	86	12.1	9.46	8.0	23	8.8	11.71	11.4	10.0	216
6293	9850	4	The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience.	1	1		1																						82	4	87	0	0	0	4.475609756097561	20.5	19	16	5	4	2	7	45	9.9	8.3	7.93	12	8.9	9.66	11.25	8.8	111
6294	9851	4	Well I think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her her attitude better known now she is changing so she is going to put her mind to whatever she has to do and she is going to take the test again with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away.	1	1		1																						59	2	60	0	0	0	3.864406779661017	29.5	8	12	0	5	2	1	39	26.3	5.94	8.17	5	21.6	24.96	31.5	0.0	72

The story shows the many difficulties saeng faces when leaving her old home and comming to her new one. In the day described. She failes a drivers test, doesn’t eat lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old home. Also, this paragraph shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes her. The plant is not in its native home, faces many difficulties; the cold its small pot, and even its general surrounding.

6310	9867	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did, because Saeng is a nature freak.

6329	9886	4	The author views the hibiscus plant as a new start.

6332	9889	4	I believe that she included this because she wanted to show important it was to her. For example when she says in the spring she will take the test again. I think that ment she will work harder to make sure she does everything right. So that she can say she follows through on things that are important to her.

6338	9895	4	The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simpley set a time for her to try again.

6362	9919	4	The author concludes  with this paragraph, to give a sense at hope and growth. The flower represents Saeng’s  homelard, and it makes her feel comforted. It connects her with her emotions and reminds her of the way are. The growth and flourishing of the hibiscus corresponds to the flourish of Saeng. When it blooms, she will have a true piece of home with her, and  will be able to take the test again. The story  is  about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change.

6369	9926	4	The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to set the final mood. The author wanted to show that Saeng will not give up and she will continue to adapt to her new surroundings. It made the end of the story feel warm and it also inspired. The end of the story encourages the reader to not give up as well. The last paragraph sets an example of how the reader can vow to improve as well. The author knew that the last paragraph would stand as an inspiration and mabe help a reader going through something similar to the story.	1	1		1																						102	6	108	0	0	0	4.264705882352941	17.0	21	19	7	5	3	6	62	7.1	6.84	7.11	11	6.4	9.15	8.333333333333334	8.8	136

6378	9935	4	The author concluded the story with saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. When walking home from her test, Saeng saw a familiar flower and chose to make a delar to a flower shop. There, she saw many flowers that reminded her of home. she bought a hibiscus and went home. Her and her mother planted it, after saeng realized the flower could make it through the winter. She looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she realized that she has adapted to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus gave courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue surviving in @LOCATION1.	2	2		2																						142	8	153	3	0	0	4.429577464788732	17.75	31	33	4	4	7	10	78	9.6	7.83	7.53	20	8.8	10.37	8.666666666666666	10.9	192
6380	9937	4	The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and strgging to survive and fit in in it’s non-natve land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported through out the story when her mother connents on the hibiscus by the late. She says, “It’s strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matter” (Ho @NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saeng’s life. Both must be strong fight through hard imes where no, one, “not even her class mates or frends, or Mrs. Lambert” (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, shes promising herself she will fight through the hard times grow strong, just as her winter hibiscus.	3	3		3																						167	8	193	10	0	0	4.526946107784431	20.875	43	22	13	13	4	32	93	9.2	8.07	7.3	14	5.8	8.88	8.333333333333334	8.8	208
6383	9940	4	The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way.	2	2		2																						73	5	78	0	0	0	4.726027397260274	14.6	17	11	5	4	5	5	41	8.1	9.16	7.39	11	6.6	8.58	8.1	10.8	103

6400	9957	4	After reading ”Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. I believe Ho ended the story with that paragraph to support her idea of overcoming  obstacles. First after failing her driving test, Saeng was very upset and didn’t know if she would ever pass it. But after seeing a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her home in Vietnam which inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive. But, after seeing how the plant brought joy to Saeng, her mother forgave her. Last when saeng was digging a hole to let the hibiscus grow, it inspired Saeng to take the test again because she overcame the obstacles of brining the plant home and letting it grow. Therefore, I believe Ho end “Winter Hibiscus”, to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles.	2	2		2																						139	8	157	9	0	0	4.642857142857143	17.5	33	28	7	7	4	21	72	9.3	8.81	6.89	18	7.7	8.4	7.142857142857142	9.8	199

I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her com fort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", This implies a new beginning so the hibiscus is representing Saeng.

Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in “a blink.” Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her.

6418	9975	4	The reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought. Also it symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says, “... this hibiscus is budding ...” (Ho @NUM1). She is also describing that they will start over when spring comes. And that leaves the reader with the last thought about Saeng, and how she has overcome living in the new place. Lastly, it ties up @CAPS1 feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved, “... I will take the test again” (Ho @NUM1), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot.

6422	9979	4	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test.

Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.	2	2		2																						82	4	88	2	0	0	4.463414634146342	20.5	18	13	2	2	0	6	51	9.8	8.18	7.16	10	7.7	9.66	11.5	9.5	109

For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus wasn’t the same as the one in her homeland.

6431	9988	4	The author Minfong Ho ends the story talking about the test Saeng failed and vowing to take it again because like in the story the test was symbolizing like slightly moving on, just kind of starting her newlife and not living in the old. But Saeng couldnt do that. She bought the flower with all her money because it held memories for her. But I think as the story goes on she kind of realizes she can have both, her old and new life. I think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again.

6470	10027	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. It’s just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring.

6475	10032	4	In the story “winter hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, it tells of a girl who just moved to a new country & is having a hard time adapting to the new land & its people. But I think the author put that quote at the end to lead you to believe to never give up, there is a new beginning & you will make it. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her.” This shows that has finally has found comfort & is confident, like the geese going to adapt in a new area, & then will come back, & that the winter hibiscus new gives up & will keep living in the new weather conditions every season.	3	2		3																						146	3	158	9	0	0	4.191780821917808	48.666666666666664	27	26	12	8	8	18	78	22.5	8.32	8.09	9	19.0	20.53	18.666666666666668	13.6	196
6477	10034	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new sorrounds. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place. In the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her. The spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming, the geese return, and the snow has melted.

6534	10091	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and her situation in a new country. It shows that Saeng is using the hibiscus and its ability to adapt for inspiration. During the story, Saeng describes how she had always seen the hibiscus at home in her old country. Her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home. But she says it’s because it’s strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the United States. This is what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She might have failed her lisence test, but she used the hibiscus actions to set a goal for herself. The plant will go through a cold, and snowy winter but it will grow and blossom in the spring. Saeng would use that time to study and get ready, and she’ll be confident for the test. The paragraph that the author finishes on shows the connection Saeng made with her situation and the plant’s situation.	2	3		3																						182	10	196	4	0	0	4.4010989010989015	18.2	47	24	11	3	11	16	104	8.4	7.78	6.53	13	6.8	9.04	11.8	10.4	243
6538	10095	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the Saeng's determination to over come the obstacles of her past experience. For example, the story starts out with Saeng taking a ‘test’,  while reliving her memories in the greenhouse, she started to breakdown. ”A wave of loss so deep and story it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" She then buys the plant and takes it home to her mother,telling her that she 'failed'. The mother then becomes understanding and helps Saeng's vow retake the 'test', the narrator emphasizes Saeng’s determination to overcome the troubles of her past and go on with the future."	2	2		2																						106	5	126	5	0	0	4.897196261682243	21.4	33	19	1	7	4	15	57	15.0	10.62	9.72	20	11.3	14.37	15.25	12.6	152
6542	10099	4	I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imagen what happens next once spring rolls around for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their imagenation to connect to the story. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that with that paragraph was to give hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time. It was also a way to end the story in a good note.	2	1		2																						86	4	90	0	0	0	4.22093023255814	21.5	22	13	3	3	0	6	49	9.2	6.91	6.36	7	8.1	9.53	11.5	8.1	113

6551	10108	4	In the story the Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho it explains the obstacles Saeng went through coming to a different country. In this story Saeng had just failed her driving test as she was reminded of her home through some tropical flowers. Moreover the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This part of the story is very important because it examines her growth and hope for change, just us the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a buetiful blossed flower. Furthermore it explains to the each that she will not give up and that she will change to the environment just as th plant lives has and the geese come back to the changed environment. That part of the story is very important for the reader, @CAPS1 it concludes Saeng thoughts and hopes for the future wile adapting to her new enviorment.	3	3		3																						182	6	193	6	0	0	4.521978021978022	30.333333333333332	46	24	10	12	7	19	104	18.1	9.12	8.22	21	13.9	16.54	19.666666666666668	13.0	243

I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there waste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason.

6553	10110	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng said she failed the test, and when spring comes back then she will take the test again. The last paragraph reads “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She really does not tell us what test she is supposed to be taking.	1	1		1																						77	3	84	5	0	0	4.467532467532467	25.666666666666668	16	13	2	7	3	10	46	18.9	8.6	8.01	6	13.6	15.92	20.25	0.0	93

6572	10129	4	The author ended the story with an unconcluded ending. What I mean is the author wrote so that he could keep readers interested so that they would want to read his other books.

6579	10136	4	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel.""

6587	10144	4	The author uses symbolism to convey a different message. Saeng said in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, and then I will take that test again. The author uses the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng gets older like the hibiscus, that then she will be ready to take that test again. The author uses symbolize to convey more of the story.	2	2		2																						69	4	76	3	0	0	4.478260869565218	17.25	17	12	5	4	3	7	37	8.3	7.83	6.78	7	7.7	8.66	10.375	10.7	96

6600	10159	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she misses her home and that affected her driving test. At her home country it was warm and she had all her family memories. In the new country it is cold and snowy, something she isn’t used to. It states she will take the test again when all them things happen because it will feel like her home country and she will be more focused on the test and not what she misses.	1	2		2																						85	4	90	1	0	0	4.223529411764706	21.25	15	12	5	3	5	6	54	9.1	6.85	6.74	7	8.1	9.46	11.375	8.1	107
6603	10162	4	I think the author conclades the story with this paragraph because it sounds hopeful. She wasn’t adapting to her new home very well and that made her feel hopeless.Saeng failed her driving test which only made things worse for her. To make things better, she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home. She found the plant to be very comforting and it helped her get passed the tough times. In the last paaragraph, Saeng is looking forward to the spring so she can retake the test and hopefully pass it this time. I think the paragraph provides a feeling of hopefulness which is way the author concluded the story the way they did.	2	2		2																						116	7	126	2	0	0	4.487179487179487	16.714285714285715	24	22	9	6	3	12	64	9.6	8.53	8.0	15	7.3	9.79	8.166666666666666	9.3	150

6615	10174	4	I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

6640	10199	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is thinking what it will be like when all of this happens.

6641	10200	4	The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to end on a good note and show hope for the future. First, throughout the story Saeng felt lonely and depressed because she missed her home in Vietnam. With all this depression Saeng saw the winter hibiscus that reminded her of her childhood memories. She felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life. The flower represented the light and hope for the future. Next, it shows perserverance factor in the story Saeng fails her drivers test and came home feeling unacomplished. When she says she will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms it shows perserverance and never giving up. Lastly, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and show a positive outlook on life. No matter where you come from with love and perserverance you can overcome any obstacle. Whether it be your school, tests or home with a little hardwork and faith you can achieve.	3	3		3																						173	10	187	4	0	0	4.658959537572255	17.3	50	24	10	6	10	14	89	9.2	8.99	7.87	27	6.5	9.0	7.142857142857142	8.8	233
6649	10208	4	The author concludes the story with the main character vowing to take the drivers test again to symbolize moving forward. “ Saeng felt a shock of recognition so inffuse, it was almost visceral.” A  pone stumbling to a florist shop the main character sees a flower that reminded her of her home land, Vietnam. “Here, let me help, mother.” In relieving  her mother in the task of planting the seed that she had bought she began to mature. After reflecting on the memories of her past and coming to peace with there   there   was nothing left stoping   her from moving  forward. “when   they come back  I will take that test again.” As she sees   geese migrating south for the winter in a v formation she sets a goal for herself and uses that goal as a tool to help herself grow and move foward in the new country she’s in. The main character vowing in “Winter Hibiscus” symbolizes moving   foward.	3	2		3																						160	8	180	4	0	0	4.329411764705882	21.25	36	32	8	11	3	21	79	26.4	9.24	9.34	22	22.9	24.32	29.5	15.5	235

6655	10214	4	At the end of the story, winter Hibiscus, the author's concluding paragraph shows many of the aspects of the story in a summary, Saeng is determined to go back to the drivers test and is open to a new beginning. The author used these concluding words in the paragraph to express the hope in Saeng of a better beginning and to show her determination to pass the drivers test. The author ties the objects in-a story to represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus is a reminder of her glorious home, spring is the time she picks because it is a new beginning, and the geese returning show the determination of her and her to resolve to become new and better.	2	2		2																						124	4	137	6	0	0	4.532258064516129	31.0	37	13	11	1	6	11	71	15.4	9.06	7.98	17	14.2	15.3	16.0	14.9	184
6665	10224	4	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a new country. In this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so. Saeng took a test and failed and in the winter, flowers fail but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms Saeng will ""bloom"" and try the test again.

6668	10227	4	I believe that the author concluded the story “Winter @CAPS1” with the paragraph that she did in order to imply that Saeng will not give up. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was very sad about failing the test, but will take the test again infers that Saeng is a determined person. It is my belief that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the feeling that Saeng was determined despite hardships.	2	1		2																						74	3	78	1	0	0	4.621621621621622	24.666666666666668	18	12	3	2	1	7	42	12.7	9.41	8.49	15	10.6	12.58	14.333333333333334	11.2	103
6677	10236	4	This story about believed in yourself, and never giving up it was a story about perseverance. Saeng really believed she could pass her driver's test, and although she was disappointed with result, she found a way to cope with her loss. The hibiscus that flower means a lot to her because she can connect it to her homeland and, and it is a thing of beauty. something she needed at such an ugly time for her. It's always hard o adapt to a new country in a short period of time. I know what it's like when one small thing goes wrong. You can snap and it will feel a lot worse than it actually is. You feel helpless and alone just like the hibiscus growing next to the highway in the photo. Saeng vowed to take her driver’s test again when her hibiscus would bloom in the spring I think the hibiscus really symbolizes Saeng as a person.	2	3		3																						159	9	175	4	0	0	4.245283018867925	17.666666666666668	32	22	10	8	6	15	97	8.5	6.73	6.71	15	7.5	9.47	11.0	9.8	209

6687	10246	4	The author of this story story created the last paragraph so that it finishes the story with a great ending. The fact of never giving up and try again again and again. The author said, ”I will take the test again.” In the story Saeng said, ”I failed the test” but now that she isn't giving up. This last paragraph makes a lot of senses and is needed to make this story complete. So just as others don't give up in @LOCATION1, Saeng is doing the same and is retaking the test.	1	1		1																						92	6	102	3	0	0	4.173913043478261	15.333333333333334	22	15	5	7	5	11	59	7.4	6.15	6.78	10	6.9	9.1	9.0	8.2	119
6691	10250	4	I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder. I think this because if you put into context the word “test”, it could mean many things. For example it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of her situation. Also it could mean the test to adjust to her new home when the spring comes. That is why I think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph.	1	2		2																						81	5	87	1	0	0	4.185185185185185	16.2	20	14	3	1	0	6	46	6.4	6.26	6.58	9	6.1	7.47	7.5	6.7	105

She just come to the new country and she haven’t adjusted herself to this new country yet. She was disappointed like “mashaft of the war afternoon starlight.” “war” showed saeng was ery upset. After she met the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland she missed it. She felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home. Last she burst into tears again. She missed her homelad very much “snows"" symbolized the difficult situation she had now. But she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. “spring” symbolized the hope to the new life saeng thought things would get better in the spring. She would succeed in the spring. She had the determination to succeed, so the author uses that paragraph at conclusion. It symbolizes hope."	3	2		3																						173	13	190	3	0	0	4.786127167630058	13.307692307692308	42	29	12	12	4	22	96	8.3	9.27	7.27	18	6.5	7.84	8.5	9.5	239

6705	10264	4	The author of winter Hibiscus , Minfong Ho ended the story in this way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough to make it through the winter. That’s what matters. “Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their lives again in @LOCATION1, that @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as pretty, but it will survive, which is what matters. Her words soothe her daughters worries about starting ore. Also, the budding hibiscus could be considered asymbol of rebirth, since it is dying and growing with the seasons.The family is dying in out a @CAPS1 family & being @CAPS2 was an @CAPS3 family. However even though they “died” as a @CAPS1 family, that does not meqan that they have lost their heritage which is why the author end talking about a flower that is both @CAPS1 & @CAPS3 just like Saeng.	3	3		3																						160	9	176	7	0	0	4.565217391304348	17.88888888888889	41	24	2	10	5	28	87	13.7	9.17	8.25	23	11.1	11.24	11.2	11.2	224
6706	10265	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will perservere through the winter and try to adapt to her new lifestyle. Moving to a new country / culture is extremely tough, and Saeng is bad, but she doesn’t  give up on creating a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, “in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,” is one of determination and hope. The entire story Saeng was struggling with adapting to her non of  and memory of her homeland give has a sense of security. The sentence wraps up her emotion and shows how strong she is @CAPS1  could easily give up on their driving test, but she won’t. It is a happy ending for somewhat of a sad story. Furthering the sentence shows Saeng’s dwoton  the her plant. This hibiscus will survive and so will Saeng when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so will Saeng. She will try as hard she can to fit in and enjoy her new life. That plant will help her through it by reminding her of vietnam us will as giving her a companion throughout the winter. The  author would not have chosen a better  conclusion for this story. The conclusion orggos  to a new hope to perservere  and sucede. As a result, the reader is test with a sense of pleasure and a good feeling torwards the story.

6717	10276	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author want to show the readers that Saeng will want to pass her driver licens test. The reason that so the reader show how detirmen Saeng do after the winter The example is that in the story Saeng fail her driver licens and was sad about. The next example is that when she find this flow she know she do it again. This show that the flower help her feel better show that she will do it again.

6722	10281	4	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph because he wants to get across to the reader that that saeng will not give up. Saeng and her family moved from Vietnam, and it has been hard for her to adjust to changes. Saeng really misses her homeland and the flowers that she sees @CAPS1 life. She explains how the winter hibiscus is not the same as the one in Vietnam so she plants this @CAPS1 type of flower and decides to wait till the spring to take the driving test. This shows that saeng wants to plant her difficulties in @LOCATION2 and think of them again in the spring when the weather and atmosphere is nice. She is not siving up but she does not want to take the difficulties till a later time. That is why the author concluded with this paragraph.	3	2		3																						145	7	153	1	0	0	4.393103448275862	20.714285714285715	33	22	6	2	7	14	88	9.6	7.78	7.49	18	7.8	9.66	10.8	9.6	190

6739	10298	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” probably chose to end the story that way because then it’s ending with a sense of hope. Also, it is showing how Saeng is adapting to her surroundings much like the winter hibiscus. In the second last paragraph, Saeng hears the hanks of the geese and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her through the course of the time Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because the time would allow her to grow and adapt even more. The hibiscus will be budding then, a sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adopting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could look to the plant for inspiration. This feeling of hope in Saeng and her future is left in the last paragraph, which is why the story ends there.	2	3		3																						147	7	159	5	0	0	4.45578231292517	21.0	34	21	8	9	4	15	85	10.1	8.07	7.36	19	7.9	10.3	14.25	10.3	195
6741	10300	4	I think that in the story “Winter Hibiscus” was a good story and also the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was like to work hard and that is why it mentions at the way end “I will take the test again” so you don’t fall and stay down you work hard and get back up and try again.	1	1		1																						64	1	65	0	0	0	3.765625	64.0	12	11	4	6	5	6	37	28.3	5.36	8.54	3	23.5	26.23	33.0	0.0	74
6743	10302	4	The story is somewhat sad. The girl misses her homeland. She is also sad because she failed her driving test. The author I think ends the story with the girl saying she will take the test again, to show that even though she is sad about her country and failing she is not going to give up. Failing a test especially a driving test stinks. Your very excited to get it but then you don’t. So the author is trying to show that despite the girls sadness she will not give up. The girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes. Also the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note you usually don’t want to leave a story sad with no solution. So she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons why the author ended the way she did but above are the more obvious.	2	2		2																						154	12	166	1	0	0	4.14935064935065	12.833333333333334	25	31	8	17	3	12	94	5.1	5.73	6.79	18	5.2	7.16	5.5	8.0	201

This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life. This also says she has precision, she will continue to try to get her license because she says, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.""

6758	10317	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is going to try keep her next plant. The reason why she says she is going to take the test again because she sold the plant to somebody. Saeng has seed the plant before as a child and that's why she was so attached to it. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will try and keep her next plant.	1	1		1																						75	4	81	1	0	0	4.346666666666667	18.75	18	12	2	2	2	5	48	8.4	7.49	5.83	4	7.1	8.05	8.625	6.0	94
6759	10318	4	The author concludes the last paragraph to show that after a time period you can come back and try something again. Or maybe when weather change this can be different for Saeng. Maybe she is relating herself to the plant as to when it come to spring  the flower will be stronger, and she feel that she will pass the test second time around when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. And it also shows how she appriate the nature because if not, why would she wait until spring and when the snow is melting. The conclusion of the story is that she do like nature, because she talk about the hibiscus.	1	2		2																						115	5	124	3	0	0	4.275862068965517	23.2	20	17	4	7	6	10	74	10.3	7.55	6.56	10	8.7	10.94	14.0	9.9	148

6779	10338	4	The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions.	3	2		3																						174	11	186	0	0	0	4.005714285714285	15.909090909090908	29	27	15	9	3	13	112	6.2	5.33	6.22	12	5.4	8.11	7.833333333333334	7.9	212

She is stressed about failing the driver’s test, country, but it is and she realizes that  nothing is  the same. Except for  one thing  that  she  quickly  recognized. A  plant called the “Winter Hibiscus.”It made her think of her old life in Vietnam. It helped her  set  through  hard  times  and she didn’t want to give up on anythings.This is exactly why Minfong Ho ends the  last paragraph  by stating  that Saeng  will retry  the driving test when the hibiscus is budding.The  flower gives her a thought of home   in  Vietnam, making her try and try again.Also,the author  ends the  story  like   this  to  state a  theme.

But in the story it talks about. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it So I think that they take care of there garden and try to make it live in the winter. So thats what I think about the last paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”	1	1		1																						139	8	152	7	0	0	4.215827338129497	17.375	24	25	3	13	8	12	86	15.8	7.21	7.29	9	12.1	14.5	17.333333333333332	8.1	164

6807	10366	4	The auther concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. first, The test is important to Saeng so that she can prove to herself that she is able to pass it. Ending with this paragraph also gives the reader some suspense as to wheather Saeng will pass or even go to take the test again. Lastly, this paragraph shows Saeng’s personality traits. It shows that she is persistent, determined, and strong willed.	2	1		2																						74	5	83	4	0	0	4.675675675675675	14.8	15	12	6	5	2	12	43	9.9	9.11	7.97	9	7.0	9.02	10.25	8.8	97
6813	10372	4	The “Winter Hibiscus” is a realativly sad, but hopeful story that uses lots of symbols. The author concluded the story with a confident ending that makes the reader feel satisfied. The two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring. “Winter Hibiscus” ends with a hopeful tone thanks to the confident vow Saeng silently makes. She had a rough day, and the author wanted to make sure she had something to look as a goal. It also reveals how strong of a person Saeng is. The author uses this conclusion paragraph to leave the reader with a hopeful and confident tone. The second reason the author concluded with that conclusion paragraph was to relate some of the objects she sees to the spring. The geese represent the new place she is living in, and the hibiscus represents her old home. This paragraph links these two symbols together, so the reader can relate them to the spring. The way the author concluded the story was brillantly done. It represents a hopeful tone, and symbols that relate to spring. It ends confidently, and leaves the reader satisfied.	2	3		3																						200	13	219	6	0	0	4.715	15.384615384615385	52	33	18	5	7	20	99	9.1	9.22	6.6	19	8.6	8.68	11.6	10.7	290
6814	10373	4	I think author concludes the with this paragraph because she wants to not give up. For example, he wants to show  us never give up at anything even if you fail. Therefore, that’s why he ends like that.	1	1		1																						38	3	44	2	0	0	4.205128205128205	13.0	3	9	0	3	0	7	27	5.1	5.96	7.18	4	4.7	6.13	5.666666666666667	6.4	48
6825	10384	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring it’s warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.	0	0		0																						69	2	71	0	0	0	4.188405797101449	34.5	16	9	2	3	2	3	41	15.6	7.44	7.41	5	13.2	15.54	19.25	0.0	87

6832	10391	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he things when the flowers come back they would be batter.

6838	10397	4	There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, she will have many more reasons to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year. She had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing @CAPS1 new beginning that she will have to go through the next year.	2	3		3																						255	15	273	3	0	0	4.352941176470588	17.0	43	54	21	9	2	14	157	7.6	7.25	6.52	23	6.4	8.21	7.2857142857142865	8.8	322
6839	10398	4	I think the author concludes the story with the phase “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” I there saying that they will be ready for them the next time they come back.	0	0		0																						58	2	63	4	0	0	4.293103448275862	29.0	11	9	3	5	2	8	35	27.8	8.03	8.96	5	21.2	23.89	30.0	0.0	68
6841	10400	4	The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a little. For example when Saeng said that she ment when the plants came back. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on two, rather than staping on talking about the v or geese to get the reader off topic. Last she also ment when the geese came back.	0	0		0																						64	4	70	2	0	0	4.1875	16.0	11	13	4	5	1	8	40	6.3	6.15	6.65	5	6.0	7.03	7.25	6.0	80
6843	10402	4	I think the author ended the story with that phrase to show that she wont give up; no matter how hard it is she keeps trying. The girl says in the story “I failed the test,” and then at the end of the story says I will take that test again so she is not willing to fail forever. I also think the author ended the story with that paragraph to make you wonder if she will ever pass the test.	1	1		1																						81	3	86	1	0	0	3.814814814814815	27.0	13	16	1	8	1	6	50	10.0	4.77	6.73	4	9.1	11.29	13.833333333333334	6.4	98
6850	10409	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng, like the geese and the hibiscus, will return again and have hope. Saeng is a little depressed in the story because she is in a new country, and just failed her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back painful emotional memories for her, but at the same time, s very comforting. Later in the story, she plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother. As her mother goes inside, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead. “Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Like the geese.” Saeng knew the geese would return in the spring, just like she would to her driving test. The hibiscus would be in bloom again too to provide her with hope. This is what the final paragraph in the story “winter hibiscus” means.	3	2		3																						166	9	188	11	0	0	4.686746987951807	18.444444444444443	37	20	16	15	4	25	90	11.0	9.11	6.86	16	9.0	10.25	11.6	10.1	226
6852	10411	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.	3	3		3																						204	7	214	4	0	0	4.6568627450980395	29.142857142857142	46	27	14	9	13	20	118	17.5	9.88	8.5	27	14.2	16.54	18.666666666666668	13.3	286
6861	10421	4	I believe the author concludes the that passage in the story to show patintions. Saeng was to wait for spring maybe it will feel like her home town again. She likes the spring better than the winter. She likes the birds the geese return in sping. They go away in winter. That way I believe the author concludes that passage.	1	1		1																						60	6	66	0	0	0	4.416666666666667	10.0	17	10	1	4	0	6	30	4.4	6.3	5.97	4	3.7	4.67	4.166666666666667	5.5	76

She does this I think because she needs time to just think things through to just remember back home and to make a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is just like Saeng.

6884	10444	4	The author concludes the story with they paragraph that they did because it's about the same thing that they opened the story with.  To introduce the story, the author tells about Saeng failing her drivers test, and then seeing a familiar plant that she wants to buy. The middle of the story is about how she is having a hard time adapting to her new home. So to conclude the story, the author puts that Saeng will take her drivers test again, once the flowers starts budding, and the geese come out. The flower and the geese remind her of home, so this tells you that thinking of her home, and the objects that make her feel at home, comfort her, and help her overcome obstacles.	2	2		2																						126	5	142	9	0	0	4.3700787401574805	25.4	30	24	4	4	6	13	73	15.0	8.14	7.71	14	12.0	13.55	10.4	8.1	160

This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, “when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the season's bring things back, she will come back. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should perservere because things just take time."	2	1		2																						112	9	131	7	0	0	4.794642857142857	12.444444444444445	24	22	6	12	2	19	65	8.1	8.98	7.29	15	5.2	7.74	6.0	8.5	149
6907	10467	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” for several reasons, @CAPS1, Saeng decides that she is determined to pass her driving test just like the hibiscus. Saeng’s mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through,” and Saeng decides to be strong like the hibiscus and make it through and pass the test. Next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to @LOCATION1 because the geese “sound familiar.” As much as she misses her old home, she is adapting. Finally, one can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, that as much as she misses her old home, she’s starting to get used to her new country and she recognizes that she ispart of it. She knows that letting her past get in the way of her will not help her pass the test and, like the plant and the geese, she will return again.	3	3		3																						206	5	226	17	0	0	4.441747572815534	41.2	40	34	13	11	9	28	120	20.1	8.66	7.9	23	15.8	17.65	18.333333333333332	11.6	260
6908	10468	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver’s test.

6917	10477	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on.	3	3		3																						152	8	169	2	0	0	4.309210526315789	19.0	33	29	14	1	5	12	87	9.7	7.14	7.31	22	9.4	10.52	8.0	9.6	207

6923	10483	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus is a reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong and she compares herself to the geese saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter the hibiscus doesn’t bloom and Saeng fails her driver’s test. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the Hibiscus thrives and the geese return it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well.	2	2		2																						105	4	109	0	0	0	4.6	26.25	28	12	9	2	7	7	57	13.4	9.46	7.8	9	10.0	11.66	14.25	10.7	141
6924	10484	4	The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did.	1	2		2																						111	6	123	6	0	0	4.423423423423423	18.5	24	20	4	6	1	16	68	10.5	7.72	7.44	10	8.4	10.32	10.8	8.2	141

6942	10502	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the authore is trying to show the reader that she realized cares about the nature and loves It so because she is waiting for the spring and as soon as the spring comes she will take the test again.

6951	10511	4	The author is concluding that anything can happen in the story. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus and her mother was getting mad at her. Saeng’s mother was mad because she spent money on the whole plant instead of planting it and then it would be a lot cheaper. When her mother was mad and in disbelief, Saeng started crying and the mother forgave her for her actions. This shows that anything can happen	1	1		1																						73	5	78	1	0	0	4.52054794520548	14.6	16	11	5	2	4	7	41	7.2	7.94	7.17	10	6.6	7.48	6.9	7.6	101
6953	10513	4	The Author concludes the story with Saeng saying a vow silently to herself to show the reader that she will grow like the hibiscus plant and take the test again, this time determined to pass it. The plant gives Saeng hope because it reminds her of the homeland that she loved so much. When the hibiscus starts budding and gaining beautiful flowers, Saeng will “bud” too and gain her license.	1	1		1																						70	3	75	2	0	0	4.6	23.333333333333332	17	15	1	5	3	7	37	11.9	9.29	8.4	11	8.8	10.46	13.0	9.7	92
6960	10521	4	The story ands with that paragraph because Saeng believes next spring when her new hibiscus is born she will have good luck to pass her driving test. It is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the drivers test. Now she beleives that on her next driving test she will have the connection to her past experiences, ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort in a time of disappointment. Which Saeng thinks can help her pass the test.	2	1		2																						89	4	95	2	0	0	4.48314606741573	22.25	24	15	6	1	1	6	48	10.8	8.65	7.58	12	8.4	11.62	12.875	10.7	118
6964	10525	4	The author had the story end with the paragraph because all the ideas are brought together and to show that Saeng is ready for whats ahead. When they put in the flower they are concluding the flowers importance and how it relates to how the girl feels being happy or sad.

6992	10555	4	The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test.

7009	10572	4	The author concludes her story with the quote, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because the author  is showing that nature and the plant are valuable to her. Saeng (who says the quote) believes that the hibiscus will help her pass the test. Earlier on in the story it shows that when she gets in trouble, she rubs the plant leaves in her hands to help her overcome the problem. The author is making the idea clear and portraying the idea that the plant helps Saeng with obstacles.	1	2		2																						114	4	127	6	0	0	4.434782608695652	28.75	28	20	3	6	4	16	61	13.8	8.25	8.24	12	10.9	12.8	13.25	9.5	144

It shows the reader that dispite what @MONTH1 happen, how bad things seem, and how hopeless you feel, there’s always a way to make it better. Saeng failed her test, was in a new land, and had lost her grandmother, but still planned to try again. like the waves on the shore, they will always try to wash away the sand by coming back again. just like these waves, Saeng is willing to try again, as should we all.	1	1		1																						94	5	108	9	0	0	4.23404255319149	18.8	18	16	5	9	3	17	53	14.2	6.92	7.2	2	10.8	12.95	16.333333333333332	7.8	110

7038	10602	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. “It shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repition of season upon season…” It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that she’s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world.

7040	10604	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1.	3	3		3																						181	9	193	3	0	0	4.49171270718232	20.11111111111111	51	29	7	4	3	15	96	9.8	8.3	7.6	21	8.8	9.14	11.8	10.5	247
7046	10610	4	"The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the motivational paragraph  because he/she wants to show the reeder that  Saeng is determined to adapt to her new life and home and overcome common  obstacles like a driver's test. Saeng had a hard time coping with her problem so she bought a hibiscus because it reminded her of home. I think that the line “and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" from the last paragraph is a symbol for growing up and overcoming obstacles. The conclusion for the story is a nice ending."	2	2		2																						104	5	118	1	0	0	4.485981308411215	21.4	27	15	9	3	4	13	58	13.2	9.06	8.11	18	12.3	13.09	15.0	12.2	151
7055	10619	4	The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects.	1	2		2																						96	5	105	4	0	0	3.84375	19.2	14	15	5	6	4	10	66	6.3	4.47	5.9	6	6.1	8.93	10.2	7.6	111
7061	10625	4	I think that the author concludes the story like this because it shows a new beginning. When the spring comes, everything comes back to life. Plants grow back, animals are seen again and the sun shines bright. This is a new beginning for them so it can be seen the same for her. She could try again because it gives her another chance. Another reason he ended the story like this is because Saeng loves nature. Maybe when nature is back around her it will give her hope and confidence to pass her test.	1	1		1																						94	7	103	2	0	0	4.351063829787234	13.428571428571429	18	15	4	6	2	10	56	5.8	6.84	6.32	5	5.0	6.21	6.714285714285714	8.8	119
7064	10628	4	The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready.	1	2		2																						116	5	123	3	0	0	4.060344827586207	23.2	17	19	10	10	3	8	68	9.5	6.62	6.99	10	7.4	10.1	13.5	8.2	137
7066	10630	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it.	1	2		2																						121	5	132	2	0	0	4.229508196721311	24.4	22	24	4	7	4	15	78	7.3	6.38	6.71	13	6.5	7.58	7.833333333333334	7.4	160
7071	10635	4	She realized that things come and go but also change. That content times of the year the world around her changed. She had no control over it. She also had to deal with living in a new country. Living in anew country was hard for Saeng. She had to eat new foods, hear new sonds, and see thing that she never had seen before. Failing her drives test was hard for her. Not knowing the launge and what going on around her was tough of on her. the world around her wasnt something she was us to. She knew she had to change herself and work harder to get what she wanted.	2	2		2																						112	10	125	2	0	0	4.0625	11.2	16	24	7	5	5	12	71	3.9	4.8	6.79	8	3.4	5.32	4.666666666666667	5.0	132

7078	10642	4	There was a specific reason as to why the author concluded the story with that quote. The author wanted to show how the plant gave Saeng a new sense of determination.

So she now was determined to battle the odds as well and retake the test she failed.	1	2		2																						75	5	80	0	0	0	4.266666666666667	15.0	16	12	5	6	4	6	43	6.2	6.49	7.54	10	5.6	9.2	7.699999999999999	9.4	100

The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden – red color yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with.  The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window.

Also because his parents were selflessly getting out of cuba so there children could have a better place to live. Lastly there was a mood of family. They were honest hardworking immagrants who extended a hand to help people in need.

""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. ""In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells and lovely cuban music playing.

Rodriguez shares a unique happy feeling with this excerpt; the feeling of great memories that have been strengthened with each day.

The excerpt furthers these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own. The description of these selfless attitudes and ways helps paint a beautiful portrait of a family, with ""extended family"" also, forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen.

7480	12228	5	The mood the author creates is the sadness of living one country where freinds and family lived. To happiness of the times they've shared in the United States. As the memoir states the center of the home was the kitchen where here parents split cooking duties and where passionate Cuban music filled the air the the kitchen's aroma. In the kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their hope of creating a better life for the family even if it meant leaving their country, freinds, and family behind. The author also creates a mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister. These are the moods the author creates throughout the memoir.	2	3		3																						129	7	140	2	0	0	4.5813953488372094	18.428571428571427	41	16	3	5	5	9	71	9.4	8.82	7.12	10	6.9	7.98	11.2	8.4	172

Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion.

7487	12235	5	In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story.	2	3		3																						157	7	168	2	0	0	4.3630573248407645	22.428571428571427	31	21	8	6	9	11	104	10.3	7.9	7.56	17	8.5	10.49	11.0	9.6	203

The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture.

The cyclist could been affected by seeing the dessert and no scenary changes for a wahile. When you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything. So this cause him to be very drossy and bored. Also the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains were cold water. Having no water out in the dessert could make you dehydrate and faint.	1	2		2																						126	7	137	2	0	0	4.2936507936507935	18.0	31	19	9	3	5	13	76	7.8	6.84	7.54	13	6.8	8.15	11.0	8.4	163
3600	5995	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. Since he is riding in the California desert, he always feels very hot and is always in constant thirst. In addition to this the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate. He finds nothing but old abondored buildings. He doesn't find anyone. No people or cars, or any sign of modern civilization. This causes him to feel a little unnerved as if something happened to him nobody would know about it. This is especially prevelent when he become dehydrated. In those ways, the cyclist is very much affected by the setting.	2	2		2																						105	9	118	3	0	0	4.580952380952381	11.666666666666666	18	14	8	8	3	14	66	6.0	7.4	7.83	18	5.5	7.73	5.333333333333333	8.5	152
3601	5996	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way the setting affects the cyclist is, in the desert, the cyclist drank more water than before. For example, the text states “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you.	1	1		1																						91	5	102	6	0	0	4.4945054945054945	18.2	27	9	6	3	1	14	51	8.8	8.01	7.49	13	8.0	9.04	8.9	8.2	123
3603	5998	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, out of date information, and rolling hills. If he had up to date information then he would probably have got water from a town that’s not empty or almost empty like a “ghost town” as the cyclist said.	2	1		2																						52	2	56	2	0	0	4.3076923076923075	26.0	14	5	3	3	2	7	30	11.9	7.55	7.96	5	9.9	11.94	14.5	0.0	70
3606	6001	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the lock of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. He frind the water but e tar like substance come out and it tasted like battery. When he left he had to go through rough road which he couldn’t travel that fast leanes of the condition of the road.	1	1		1																						62	3	65	0	0	0	4.048387096774194	20.666666666666668	17	10	2	1	2	6	34	8.0	5.92	8.48	9	7.8	10.86	11.666666666666666	9.7	79
3607	6002	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time geting to Yosemite National Park. This is because the sun was out, and it was in the middle of June. I was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day. When the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills"", which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road."	2	2		2																						115	6	128	5	0	0	4.139130434782609	19.166666666666668	25	13	9	10	1	13	71	7.7	6.09	6.79	8	7.2	9.07	8.166666666666666	8.8	144
3612	6007	3	As the cyclist is travelling to Yosemite National Park, he comes across many features in the area that affects him. First, he takes directions from some old guys who don’t know anything about the changes in maps because they never leave their porch. At first, it affects him in a positive way, because he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, the affect later came negative because it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed. Another feature that affected him wasted the setting which was a desert-like area. The heat made it harder for him to ride his bike, and he also drank a lot of his water. This later resulted in him becoming dehydrated. A positive affect was when he found the bait shop, where he rehydrated himself and got some new directions.	2	3		3																						138	8	155	7	0	0	4.615942028985507	17.25	28	23	9	8	2	16	80	9.0	8.52	8.04	19	7.7	9.82	9.0	11.2	195
3614	6010	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One example is the hot sun that was beating down on him made him very thirsty. Another feature is the rough road that wore the cyclist out and made him tired. My last example is the old juice factory with the picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it made the cyclist feel like giving up because he thought he would die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways.	1	1		1																						96	5	101	0	0	0	4.3125	19.2	22	11	11	1	1	4	57	8.5	7.43	6.07	8	7.2	8.93	11.2	10.4	129
3616	6012	3	Understanding, realitic, mode-all are reason’s how setting affects the setting. If a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good. When you have a setting it’s more understable of what they are trying today. And if you have a good setting it makes it more realitic So when you read it you wont be thrown off, the mode of the story sets it all off, because usually books have there ups and downs. That’s why they chase the mode.	0	0		0																						83	6	95	4	0	0	4.325301204819277	13.833333333333334	17	11	6	6	2	14	49	7.3	6.78	7.12	6	6.2	8.09	7.9	7.6	105
3621	6017	3	The setting in the story changes many times. It starts in an area with rivers and pine trees. Then the cyclist arrives ant a town. After that he is pounded by the hot sun and along hilly road. With not much water left the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink. The setting was what made the cyclists journey a hard one.	1	1		1																						74	6	80	0	0	0	4.027027027027027	12.333333333333334	17	12	6	1	2	6	45	3.7	4.74	6.81	6	3.4	5.46	5.333333333333333	5.5	89
3622	6018	3	The features of the settings affect in the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit” it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart. Then..leaves and see these wide bunch of hills. inconclusion I would never do all the riding he did.	1	2		2																						83	4	88	0	0	0	4.289156626506024	20.75	16	13	4	5	5	8	53	19.5	8.14	9.12	11	15.9	17.08	21.75	0.0	106
3631	6027	3	Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.” His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn’t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel.	3	3		3																						240	8	258	6	0	0	4.308333333333334	30.0	58	37	22	9	10	30	124	16.0	7.85	8.83	33	13.0	15.48	14.25	11.2	305
3633	6029	3	The features of the selling effect the cyclist a lot. One factor that would effect the cyclist would be the heat. Also, because of this factor, he’s pobably suffering from lack of water. He’s probably really hot seeing he’s the only one cut in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles. Another feature of the setting that would probably effect the cyclist is the thought of there @MONTH1 be a car around this next turn. If he can’t see around the next turn he doesn’t know is coming. The cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up.	1	1		1																						104	7	113	2	0	0	4.4326923076923075	14.857142857142858	26	13	5	8	0	13	62	6.9	7.3	6.96	11	5.6	7.11	7.0	8.4	140
3640	6036	3	"I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” this shows that he is a warm and trobled by the change of the terrain. He also fells alone “I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path” he also. Though he was in a ghost town. “Summer time” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my detorating brain"" he felt that he was slowly dying. He also though he was losing it, the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was no seeing a mirage. But through it all he had hopes the author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things dont look good keep moving foward never look back and alway's be positive and take advanage of your surrounding.

3641	6037	3	Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared.

When the old men told him to take a difficult path and did his in tire setting changed for the worst. After this he was nearly over powered by devastating hills and dehydration was slowly creeping up on him as well. He had not nearly packed enuff water or supplies for a change such as that and he would regret it later. The Hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and mercilous mankind it even worse on him. This is how the change of setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						107	7	114	1	0	0	4.289719626168225	15.285714285714286	19	11	11	11	7	8	64	7.7	6.9	7.32	14	6.7	8.62	8.166666666666666	8.8	140

There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water.

3656	6052	3	How the setting of the place effects the cyclist is for one its to dry a cyclist would be ridy for haurst shouldn’t be in a place that’s dry.Like in the story it says “I was travelling through the high parts of California in June” meaning it was really hot and dry.Second would be the animals there dangerous.A cyclist should be riding in a place with diamond back snakes it says in the text “I toiled on.At some point,tumbleweeds crossed my path t a ridiculously larger skilt it really did look like adiamond back” which if it really has one would be really dangerous  & cyclist should not be riding in that type of dangerous places no matter what type there are.That is how the settings of the surrandings effect the cyclist & how can it’s a bad place for them to ride.	2	2		2																						143	6	157	1	0	0	4.221476510067114	24.833333333333332	35	14	11	9	3	20	83	70.0	9.37	13.65	13	55.9	58.39	62.0	0.0	195

3666	6062	3	The bike rider in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1, is greatly affected by the condition of land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running, low on water. However since it is such a dry place he can’t find any. Also since it is out in the middle of no where, there is no one he can ask for some.

3671	6067	3	The features that affected the cyclist was plenty of things. One thing would be lack of water. In the text he said the pump gave water that taste like battery acid. Another one would be all the surroundings changed from what the old men sald and he got lost. When he was lost he had to have determination to find someone say that he could survive.	1	1		1																						66	5	71	0	0	0	4.2727272727272725	13.2	16	12	2	0	1	6	38	5.3	6.19	7.4	7	4.9	7.1	6.4	8.2	84
3675	6071	3	In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclist’s surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in “the high deserts of California in June,” the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings.	2	2		2																						101	7	117	8	0	0	4.762376237623762	14.428571428571429	24	9	10	8	4	20	55	8.2	8.69	9.2	22	6.5	7.74	7.0	8.8	145
3678	6074	3	The features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist. He’s in California in June, and it’s very hot. It’s pretty much a desert. When he stops for water, the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops. Also, the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid. So this is not very good for the cyclist.	2	2		2																						69	6	78	3	0	0	3.971014492753623	11.5	17	4	6	7	1	10	44	3.0	3.81	6.27	4	3.1	5.18	4.916666666666667	5.5	82
3679	6075	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the “resevoir compground” he’s feeling pretty good because he’s just leaving “the serenity of an early-summer evening and he’s headed toward “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” He’s in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he’s anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the “ghost town” and the “sun was beginning to beat down” he’s less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, he’s still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once “a thriving little spot.” Next, when the cyclist comes to “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral” he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a “tarlike substance” so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the “rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake” it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom” and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better.	3	3		3																						239	8	264	14	0	0	4.7489539748953975	29.875	48	34	23	26	15	41	128	15.9	10.17	8.49	34	12.6	13.47	20.333333333333332	12.2	330
3681	6077	3	The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn’t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						96	5	107	6	0	0	4.572916666666667	19.2	19	11	6	9	2	12	59	16.2	9.3	7.7	10	13.3	13.94	18.0	11.2	131
3685	6081	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist.

3686	6082	3	Sun, amount of miles, people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot. Also, he said that he really didn’t seem to notice it through in his mind it affected the cyclist. Next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept,	1	1		1																						71	4	80	6	0	0	4.47887323943662	17.75	17	12	1	5	1	9	44	8.5	7.65	7.19	8	7.9	8.81	10.125	9.5	98
3689	6085	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonist’s problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June, “ and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because ” The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it.	3	3		3																						215	7	233	9	0	0	4.534883720930233	30.714285714285715	45	33	18	20	7	26	116	21.4	9.36	9.15	37	17.7	19.06	18.333333333333332	13.0	299
3691	6087	3	The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn’t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.	2	2		2																						78	6	84	0	0	0	4.294871794871795	13.0	19	14	4	5	0	7	47	5.3	6.25	6.31	6	4.8	6.23	6.0	7.2	103

Either that, of the towns said to be, “a ghost town.” @CAPS1 this couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is “traveling through the deserts of California in June.” Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels.	3	2		3																						132	8	141	2	0	0	4.492424242424242	16.5	32	14	6	13	4	14	79	10.7	8.18	7.96	14	9.5	11.53	11.0	10.9	183
3704	6100	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the essay, it states, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.” This statement might affect the cyclist in the way that, they fear if they get into any trouble there is no one around to help out. This statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way. In the essay, it states, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral they couldn’t had in the larger mule greeted me.” This statement simply gives the cyclist the impression that this particular town is juice, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, @MONTH1 be decades. The different features of the journey of the cyclist in the essay, many would fear the outcome,if they over fear the journey and turned “old timers” who had never left their porches, in order to experience such things.	1	2		2																						175	7	198	13	0	0	4.537142857142857	25.0	46	24	12	6	4	24	102	17.5	8.89	7.99	17	13.4	14.91	13.0	9.4	228

3711	6107	3	In the story “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The most challenging problem faced  by the author was the lack of water. “ I pumped that handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t calm down nor I tried a drip or two,it had the flaver of beatterly acid.When @CAPS2 set out for the next train @CAPS2 came to a road that read “Rough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.

The effected the determination the cyclist had left @CAPS2 the regreted not listening to the old men of didn’t think they knew what they were talking about.

3714	6110	3	'Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit’ by Joe Kurmaskie demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. First off, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle. This affected her because if they had been in a car, or on a bus alot less energy would have been used up. Secondly, the cyclist started running out of water. This setting didn’t help because they were on a bike so that kept them hydrated. Another setting that affected the plot was the deserted towns. If they hadn’t been deserted everything would have been better. These features affected the cyclist a great deal.	1	2		2																						108	8	120	3	0	0	4.638888888888889	13.5	25	15	6	3	1	15	63	7.2	8.4	7.52	13	6.2	7.99	8.0	10.7	156

For example, after @NUM1 miles he looked upon the “ramshackeled sched, several rusty bumps and the corral… This sight troubled me. In the desert his water tasted like the flavor of “battery acid.” It also goes on to say that it was a “test for my inner spirit.” It also states that he went along with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds. This passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did and made it with a little confidence. Although his situation was somewhat unbearable he still kept striving on.	2	2		2																						112	6	120	2	0	0	4.584070796460177	18.833333333333332	21	18	11	4	2	15	68	11.5	9.29	9.12	23	9.7	12.17	14.25	11.2	157
3728	6124	3	“Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from California June, but not none the less. Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12. And worse a billboard of “a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding contributed to his hoplessness.	2	3		3																						140	8	156	10	0	0	4.564285714285714	17.5	41	17	11	9	6	21	71	8.8	8.12	8.68	29	7.8	10.43	7.0	10.1	196
3735	6131	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the author in many ways. One feature was the hills. The speed limit affected the author because he felt that he was moving to slow.

3737	6133	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn’t have much water to drink.	1	1		1																						53	3	59	3	0	0	4.150943396226415	17.666666666666668	11	7	4	3	2	7	35	7.0	5.86	8.09	5	5.5	7.83	8.166666666666666	6.4	64
3745	6141	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The @LOCATION1 desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist. For example the was further route, he takes is not only @LOCATION1, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he @MONTH1 restock on water and become hydrated once again.	2	2		2																						91	7	100	3	0	0	4.604395604395604	13.0	23	16	5	7	4	12	51	7.8	8.05	8.03	17	6.9	8.72	7.75	9.3	131
3746	6142	3	Many different things affected on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a “ghost town” there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, directions he was given, and lack of water. When the cyclist come across the bait shop he know he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and water.	2	2		2																						149	6	164	8	0	0	4.530201342281879	24.833333333333332	39	18	14	2	5	14	80	12.3	8.71	7.62	14	9.4	11.8	14.5	10.5	198
3747	6143	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says “ The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was don’t ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh”. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back..

3749	6145	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he’ll have later on. As he passes a snake, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” So the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, “…I could drop from heatstroke…” meaning he’s starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. Which effects him because he’s beginning to loose hope and  thinks he’s not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story.	2	3		3																						173	9	190	6	0	0	4.27683615819209	19.666666666666668	40	31	10	8	6	23	86	11.5	7.78	8.15	22	9.4	11.5	13.75	9.6	225
3756	6152	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...” This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip."	2	2		2																						124	7	145	7	0	0	4.672	17.857142857142858	26	17	11	9	5	17	69	11.1	8.94	8.74	22	9.0	12.15	12.2	11.9	172
3764	6160	3	The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.” This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration.	2	1		2																						113	7	128	7	0	0	4.876106194690266	16.142857142857142	33	17	8	3	4	14	57	12.9	10.45	7.97	17	9.7	11.87	11.2	11.2	160

3768	6164	3	The cyclist lost hope because he was in the California desserts in June. The cyclist started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump that pumped out battery-acid tasting water. When he said the sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, was very cautious. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.

3785	6181	3	The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to “short, rolling hills”. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.” He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless.	2	3		3																						129	6	135	1	0	0	4.465116279069767	21.5	22	26	6	8	4	9	77	10.4	8.24	7.64	15	9.3	10.46	11.2	9.3	176

3798	6194	3	The setting affects the biker in many ways. For one, he is riding through the high deserts of California during the month of June. It is naturally hot in the summer, but in the desert, it is twice as hot. This means he will dehydrate quicker, and will need more water. The only water the biker can find is from an old pump, but he couldn’t drink it since it was so hot; nasty tasting. “When I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acid” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was deserted, so nobody could help him. Also, the terrain was bad. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,” (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous. The biker is being affected in many ways, both mentally and physically.	3	3		3																						200	14	229	11	0	0	4.5	14.285714285714286	38	30	18	15	5	31	109	8.1	7.6	7.39	28	7.4	9.48	8.166666666666666	10.3	276
3799	6195	3	The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was faced with a desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die…”. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst.

The cyclist started at a camp ground and conversing with some old dogers, and he asks them how to get to Yosemite, and the tell him a shortcut that turns out to be out of date. On the road to Yosemite he sees nothing except abandoned towns. He is really thirsty and there’s no water anywhere. He thought he was going to die. He said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It was a hot summer day and there was tumbleweeds and snakes by the road and him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it was cooler and if there was a big river flowing by the road.

3823	6219	3	The setting of this essay was the California desert in June. If any of the settings features affected the cyclist(which they all did) This had the biggest impact. In the fifth paragraph, the reader leaves that the author was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” My prior knowledge tells me that California is generally always a very hot place especially in the desert in June, the hottest month of the year This would have greatly affected the cyclist. He was riding for over fifty miles through the California desert  with a limited supply of water. This put him at a great risk for dehydration, which he tells the reader he reaches in the last time of paragraph ten. This terrain and the extremely hot conditions would make the cyclist very tired and dehydrated, making his journey to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 all the more difficult.	2	2		2																						146	7	158	4	0	0	4.836734693877551	21.0	38	14	12	9	2	17	82	13.6	10.62	8.3	26	11.6	13.01	15.25	12.7	216
3824	6220	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn’t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						161	13	188	8	0	0	4.177914110429448	12.538461538461538	37	27	7	8	5	26	95	5.2	5.68	6.95	12	5.0	6.6	8.0	8.1	207
3829	6225	3	"The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worst he personally felt. For example, when he hit the ghost town, he just laughed. Once he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of once exisiting civilization, and he says, ”This sight is troubling,”. Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him. The climate in the story also becomes @CAPS1 difficult.

The setting takes place in the deserts of California, in early summer. There are no other people in there, no establishments, towns, etc. ; @CAPS1 dangerous feature of the setting in addition to it being in a desert in summer, for example the author is the town learntedat “might have been a thriving little spot at one time-sat, before the last world war’. The cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water. For example he says “I was going to lie…slowly gaining elevation while losing hope”. The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives. He lerns, because the setting the setting is now lifeles and deserted, to not listen to old people who remember the current setting on if as it was many decades earlier. Because the features of the setting nearly kill the cyclist, the cyclist learns a lesson.	3	2		3																						187	9	208	10	0	0	4.553191489361702	20.88888888888889	53	23	11	13	2	27	99	10.6	8.65	7.89	28	10.2	10.86	11.6	10.5	272

3848	6244	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example the tumbleweeds and the snakes. Being that its not out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																						96	7	103	0	0	0	4.479166666666667	13.714285714285714	24	8	4	5	3	7	60	6.5	7.71	6.78	9	6.3	7.15	6.714285714285714	8.4	132
3863	6259	3	When cycling or doing any outdoor sport, the setting matters greatly. If its cold you need a jacket. Hot you need water. Depending on how secure it could be life or death. It could be realy hilly and you might get tired, and if you have no water you could die. Also it depends if its in a city burbed, small town, desert, highway all these factors play a huge roll in cycling	3	2		3																						73	6	83	5	0	0	4.1506849315068495	12.166666666666666	16	12	5	4	4	10	40	4.2	5.09	6.62	10	3.3	5.43	5.25	5.5	91
3866	6262	3	"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,”  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist.

The cyclist listened to the old men so therefour he traveled a good distance. So that made matters bad. With having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst. The cyclist thought of him dying and the birds picking him clean, because he thought he would die because dehydration. The conditions of the road made it harder, First he started with nothing but straight roads then ended up going up and down hill. In conclusion, the cyclist hit many obstacles that made his trip harder then what he thought.	2	2		2																						132	9	144	3	0	0	4.621212121212121	14.666666666666666	31	22	13	7	2	14	73	7.7	8.34	7.48	21	6.7	7.7	5.875	8.2	181
3880	6276	3	As if along bike ride through the city isn’t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. “High deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good.	3	2		3																						158	9	176	9	0	0	4.6835443037974684	17.555555555555557	39	17	12	11	4	26	89	10.5	9.05	8.42	28	8.7	11.21	12.0	10.4	229
3890	6286	3	There were many features of the setting that affect he cyclist to make his difficut journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise. For example, “I followed their advice and launched out at first line, nd along a ‘short cut” that was toslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed @CAPS1, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate. For example, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death. For example “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This is stating without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die.	2	3		3																						189	10	206	9	0	0	4.431578947368421	19.0	49	24	18	6	3	26	103	13.1	8.25	8.23	28	10.3	12.7	13.75	10.6	247
3894	6290	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when he arrived to the first town the water had tasted like battery acid which made the rider concerve water another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature. The ride would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster.	1	1		1																						65	3	68	0	0	0	4.3076923076923075	21.666666666666668	17	9	5	1	0	4	37	9.7	7.43	7.87	9	9.4	10.53	12.166666666666666	9.7	89
3897	6293	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie’s, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""This sentence from the text stores he is dehydrated, because of this it creates an obstacle he must face. Also, another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is, the rough road ahead he had to face. “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign I would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead. Luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well."	2	1		2																						129	8	144	7	0	0	4.457364341085271	16.125	35	19	4	8	2	19	68	15.7	8.43	8.05	17	13.5	14.47	18.666666666666668	11.2	177
3898	6294	3	There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One feature is the climate. When you are cycling and it is really hot you can dehydrate very fast. If it is really cold it is harder to breath and catch your breath. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep than you will get very tired quickly and when it is rocky you have a posablity to fall off the bike and hurt yourself. Last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist. Also if the road is so isolated and you get hurt who would find you. This is another deadly situation. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						166	11	178	1	0	0	4.150602409638554	15.090909090909092	27	19	14	11	6	12	112	5.7	5.79	6.19	14	5.6	7.0	7.0	8.6	217
3905	6301	3	In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town the setting isn’t described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isn’t in working condition. Until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living , when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in.	3	3		3																						215	14	232	5	0	0	4.441860465116279	15.357142857142858	62	26	15	9	9	19	121	7.8	7.77	7.11	22	6.2	7.35	7.833333333333334	7.0	288
3909	6305	3	The setting it the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” in three ways. One way is that it is very baren so there is no shade to stop the sun that is beating down the the cyclist body which adds to his dehydration and lack of to focus. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the terrain the rolling hills, and desert he bikes through the hills make him work harder using up more energy and exsusaing his ater supply the desert also with it enemies heat make his not trust himself thinks there mirages he sees. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns when he sees them he get a hope of relief that he might get water and out the heat but when he passes in he finds nothing and leaves him chrested and think of death.	3	2		3																						147	4	153	1	0	0	4.115646258503402	36.75	34	27	4	4	7	11	87	16.4	6.92	9.01	19	12.9	15.81	18.333333333333332	9.5	182
3913	6309	3	In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water. He also had to manuver around a snake. It made him tired and dehydratied.

He got dehydratied from the sun.	1	1		1																						45	5	50	0	0	0	4.355555555555555	9.0	9	6	3	2	1	7	27	3.6	5.54	6.19	6	3.3	4.49	3.9000000000000004	6.7	60
3918	6314	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist because if you are going down hil and then hit a rough road you not going to do so good.

3919	6315	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.	1	2		2																						73	4	78	0	0	0	4.232876712328767	18.25	18	10	7	2	3	5	41	7.6	6.85	7.57	9	6.9	8.42	8.875	8.1	96
3921	6317	3	There are many ways in which the setting of “Rough Road ahead” affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a problem because it is very dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” It is obvious here that lack of water is affecting his in a big way. He almost collapsed because he is so thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Since there was rolling now, the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop. Lastly, the “rough road” affected the cyclist. The road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so I could renew my energy. The heat, remotness of the area, and the rough road all affected the cyclist on his journey.	2	1		2																						205	13	227	10	0	0	4.151219512195122	15.76923076923077	42	30	14	13	5	28	128	6.7	5.86	6.8	23	6.4	8.6	6.857142857142857	8.8	262
3931	6327	3	In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit”(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end.	2	2		2																						176	7	190	5	0	0	3.8983050847457625	25.285714285714285	36	29	7	11	4	20	107	11.7	5.47	7.24	13	10.0	12.63	17.666666666666668	7.8	211
3940	6336	3	"The dry desert like setting would affect the cyclist because he could easily become dehydrated from the sun, and loss of water through sweat. The cyclist states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Rough Road Ahead). The man is badly dehydrated, but in his determination he moves on. The terrain went from being flat, to short rolling hills. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water. The man goes can to say, “ I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me ""(Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviosly desert like, so it is dry, hot, and dusty. This would definately have an affect on his body which is sweating, which causes dehydration due to water loss. In conclusion the cyclist was greately affected by the setting."	3	2		3																						166	10	193	13	0	0	4.632530120481928	16.6	44	23	10	8	5	30	84	9.6	8.59	7.31	21	8.1	9.77	8.333333333333334	10.3	227
3946	6342	3	First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a “shortcut” that will take him right to his destination. Then the cyclist was faced with rough rolling hills of a highway. Over his long journey the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination.	1	1		1																						54	4	59	1	0	0	4.666666666666667	13.5	11	8	5	4	0	5	31	7.3	8.63	7.52	7	5.0	6.88	6.5	8.1	71
3947	6343	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in @LOCATION1 in he middle of June he wouldn’t of gotten so dehydrated. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to @NUM1° degrees. In the middle of @DATE2 in @CAPS1.A it bearly reaches @NUM2° degrees. Also the desert is know to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in “No @CAPS2’s @CAPS3”. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels.	1	1		1																						142	8	155	3	0	0	4.584507042253521	17.75	42	17	7	14	2	20	80	8.0	8.18	8.09	20	7.1	7.45	5.75	8.5	196
3954	6350	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, One way was the weather. In the story it said “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kermaskie @NUM1). Thats quote said he is in a desert and desert are usally warm. It also said in June and June is usally a hot temp month. The weath affected the cyclist because it was hot and he started to become dehydrated and had little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the souroundings. In the story it said. “There was no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind “(kurmaskie). That saying there know one around to help him so if he gets hurt or something. Also theres no where to get some water.	2	1		2																						131	11	148	2	0	0	4.343511450381679	11.909090909090908	34	17	6	6	6	16	74	6.3	6.55	6.89	12	5.4	7.98	7.571428571428571	9.4	176
3955	6351	3	Many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the “high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 about that passage says blistering heat; high meaning its going to be closer to sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closet water supply was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” there was a “long crippling hill” all while the sun was heating down.  All of that would most obviously effect the cyclists by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing conscionous.	2	3		3																						119	4	133	9	0	0	4.775	30.0	28	14	11	5	2	21	64	21.1	10.4	9.06	23	16.4	17.56	14.0	12.5	169
3965	6361	3	Durring the cyclist @CAPS1 he was affected by the setting frequently. When he was cycling it be came very hott to him but at first it wasn’t so bad. “The sun was begining to beat dow, but I barely Noticed it.” This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not affect him. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was travling in. “I had been hitting my water bottles pritty regularly and I was travling through the high dezerts in califonia in June.” This proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out. All of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his @CAPS2.	2	2		2																						123	8	130	1	0	0	4.308943089430894	15.375	22	20	4	8	5	17	71	14.2	7.79	8.5	18	11.8	14.27	19.333333333333332	11.7	165
3970	6366	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states “with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind”, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel.

The setting plays a big part in his ""challenge"", from the pine trees to the barren hills. In the begining of his trie he passes a ""gbost town"" that has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that, ""had my name written all over them."" This gives him hope and reassurance. Then the rusty pump and ""ramshackle shed."" They took the hope and reasurance away, making him cautrous. The hills that made him work hard to get over, the snake that slowed him down and the whelches juice company that was abundanded all didn't help and made matters worse. Then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better. It the setting has less the same the whole way he wouldn't have had any hope or he would have hope but it wouldn't fall and rise, making the story interenting."	3	3		3																						188	11	218	8	0	0	4.398936170212766	17.09090909090909	44	28	16	8	12	27	113	7.8	7.02	7.51	21	6.4	9.18	7.2857142857142865	9.1	240

But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned.

Dehydration caused by heat could not enough water caused the cyclist to sweat and to feel nautious. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh. In this quote he is thinking about all the bad and horrible things that could happen to him because he is already in an bad state.

4010	6406	3	Some of the things that affect the cyclist was the lack of water. “The water, bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, water is a big importance. To stort men. Your body need water to work right. The @CAPS1 humid, dry weather of California was a affect To. “The high deserts of California in June.” “l could drop from a heatstroke.” The sun is unbearable, expessary without shade and water, @CAPS2 affect on the cyclist up.

4021	6417	3	In the essay intitled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit” the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, “At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.” This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of “old-timers.” From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, “About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first “town”, a ghost town,” “The sun was beginning to heat down,” This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a “A Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood.	3	3		3																						272	8	293	13	0	0	4.268382352941177	34.0	83	31	14	14	7	37	144	25.9	7.79	8.89	26	21.0	23.23	29.0	14.3	360
4025	6421	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like hes coming or going on a vacation and because of the way hes riding it it seems hes going real fast as about to fall.	1	1		1																						57	1	61	0	0	0	3.9473684210526314	57.0	9	10	0	3	4	1	35	25.7	6.4	8.96	5	22.0	24.2	30.5	0.0	75
4043	6439	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by that he or she should behave act or talk according to the settings. It means that where ever they are existing and whatever it looks like, they need to fit them self in. They also need to fit the mood according to where they are located. The cyclist is feeling comfortable according to the story and he dosent need any change in setting or location. For conclusion the features of the setting affects the cyclist by that he needs to make improvment and changes according to where he or she is located.	1	1		1																						101	5	107	1	0	0	4.465346534653466	20.2	18	22	1	2	7	6	60	9.7	8.3	7.61	14	8.8	11.25	12.2	12.0	141
4044	6440	3	In the beginning the cyclist was ready to go and happy. By the time he got half way there he was “losing hope”. It was very hot and he was simple alone. By the end, he was relieved because not only did he find water, he found an easier way to get to Yosemite. The first old group of men didn’t help, but the second man did.	1	1		1																						67	5	74	3	0	0	3.8358208955223883	13.4	13	9	9	4	3	10	40	3.4	3.7	5.95	4	3.8	5.96	6.1	6.7	81
4049	6445	3	In the passage “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” the setting must definetly affects the cyclist. When the cyclist comes for the first abandured “town” he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” The makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water it is just undrinkable. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist in on his last legs he must work even harder to get water a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” this quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist most perservere. Also quote “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridicuosly large snake –“tumble weeds and snakes give the feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is what the cyclist is this point. The setting of this story directly correalates with how the cyclist is feeling.	3	3		3																						165	6	172	3	0	0	4.6909090909090905	27.5	42	20	11	14	5	18	88	17.2	10.22	8.91	24	13.8	15.62	18.0	11.6	225
4057	6453	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it say that the temperture was was getting high and that when he drank the water that it test like battery acid. This would affect him because it it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot how would he be able to get through the day with out pasing out also in paragraph @NUM2 it say the roads changed to hill when you ride up and down the hills you become tired from pumping you legs then you would feel hot and tiredd and would not want to ride the bike. That how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						117	4	120	0	0	0	4.102564102564102	29.25	21	19	6	5	5	8	74	17.4	6.86	8.0	9	13.8	15.94	25.5	6.4	141
4059	6455	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town. ""This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on."	2	3		3																						193	10	217	11	0	0	4.896373056994818	19.3	45	27	12	11	6	24	106	12.4	10.33	8.87	40	10.5	12.5	15.5	12.7	291
4062	6458	3	The features in the setting of this story affect the cyclist very much so. Throughout this story this poor person has to get lost and end up in the middle of nowhere. By her being out her cycle was being affected. She was just trying to get somewhere and get things done, but of course she didn’t. She kept moving on down. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it bad.	1	1		1																						76	6	83	1	0	0	4.171052631578948	12.666666666666666	11	15	3	9	5	7	51	4.5	5.5	6.97	8	4.7	5.61	5.5	5.5	96
4068	6464	3	When the cyclist went to ask about the road the old men told him all its good way that he should go. But the old man hasn’t seen the land in a really long time. The man don’t long that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends ?? the cyclist didn’t know what to do.	1	1		1																						65	5	70	0	0	2	3.830769230769231	13.0	12	12	5	4	2	8	35	4.9	4.46	6.4	1	4.8	6.4	7.625	7.2	74
4075	6471	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it’s very hot outside and he is starting to loose energy. The setting affects how fast he rides when he stops or when he drinks or eats. all of these depend on the type of weather he is riding in. like in the story it was so hot out when he saw a building he wiped the sweat from his face to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.	1	1		1																						74	4	78	0	0	0	3.891891891891892	18.5	12	13	4	4	3	6	43	15.4	5.58	8.46	5	13.0	15.34	19.0	0.0	91
4082	6478	3	The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn’t find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another.	3	3		3																						198	11	212	4	0	0	4.409090909090909	18.0	40	36	10	12	9	20	116	9.2	7.72	8.05	32	8.7	10.75	12.0	11.0	280

4092	6488	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didn’t have much water. In the text it says “I was traveling the high desserts of California in June.” The deserts are always hot and June is a very hot month. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasn’t able to drink much because he had limited water.	1	1		1																						75	3	78	0	0	0	4.28	25.0	20	8	9	4	3	6	40	11.2	7.55	7.82	7	9.5	11.6	13.833333333333334	9.7	98
4094	6490	3	In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the setting greatly affects the cyclist. With long rides, hilly roads, and very little water the cyclist was pretty good. I mean he could have been very angry but he kept his cool and stayed calm.	1	1		1																						45	3	50	2	0	0	4.4	15.0	9	6	6	5	3	5	21	6.8	7.01	7.89	6	5.6	6.0	6.5	3.1	58
4095	6491	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welch’s Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,” describes the cyclist, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the “shortcut.” “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,” reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, “ By the looks of it- had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.	3	3		3																						194	8	214	15	0	0	4.577319587628866	24.25	53	21	16	11	4	29	106	19.5	9.01	8.57	25	16.1	16.76	28.5	11.2	262
4102	6498	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being hott affected him because it mad him more thirsty.

4105	6501	3	The setting of the place was “ghost town” as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldn’t ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of new world because they told him the wrong directions.	1	1		1																						64	4	68	0	0	0	4.0	16.0	16	7	6	2	0	7	36	5.4	5.28	5.91	3	4.8	7.65	7.5	7.2	78

4123	6519	3	First the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem. That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn’t trust the guy. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desteart road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn’t attack him. Finally the biker faced his  las long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water.	2	2		2																						181	11	195	1	0	0	3.9395604395604398	16.545454545454547	34	38	13	16	9	14	103	5.4	4.93	7.07	12	5.0	7.26	10.8	7.3	218
4127	6523	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat in “the high deserts of California in June. The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds rattle snakes and ghost towns. All of these make the cyclist start to give up hope. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally.	2	2		2																						95	7	105	3	0	0	4.863157894736842	13.571428571428571	28	12	3	6	4	10	49	8.2	9.74	7.3	12	7.4	8.81	7.357142857142858	10.3	143
4135	6531	3	I read “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by accepting advice from “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches @CAPS1 was in office”	1	1		1																						41	1	41	0	0	0	4.682926829268292	41.0	15	8	1	0	0	7	17	21.1	10.64	11.83	12	16.9	18.35	22.5	0.0	59
4136	6532	3	In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states “The sun was beginning to beat down,” @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says “@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states “dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting.	2	3		3																						160	9	180	10	0	0	4.475	17.77777777777778	51	25	9	7	3	27	84	9.6	7.72	7.89	20	7.6	9.0	8.0	8.5	210
4145	6541	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says “…and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…” @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote “…ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool.	2	2		2																						138	5	152	6	0	0	4.028368794326241	28.2	31	17	16	3	4	17	78	11.8	6.33	7.64	15	9.3	12.2	10.6	8.2	171
4151	6547	3	He’s on a very hot climate, in a desert, so he needs lots of water, but he has a limited supply. He’s riding on hills, which makes it even harder. He can’t find any towns that aren’t abandoned.	2	2		2																						38	3	45	4	0	0	4.105263157894737	12.666666666666666	10	6	2	5	1	10	19	4.3	4.57	9.67	5	3.5	6.13	5.666666666666667	6.4	46
4157	6553	3	"Many things about the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. The terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts. This contributes to the cyclist nagging sensation for a drink of water. The ride on the hills and through the desert, also tire him out dramatically. Not to mention while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finds the water it is “tarlike” and ""in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. The cyclist in this story really must want to get Yosemite National park if he is willing to go all through all this trouble. The old men he asked in Lodi, California hadn’t left the town in decades and gave the cyclist faulty directions that could of killed him. So he asked for directions and was given inadequet information, which made life very difficult for the cyclist."	2	2		2																						147	7	160	4	0	0	4.673469387755102	21.0	36	20	9	9	6	18	82	9.8	9.28	8.09	22	8.1	10.35	8.666666666666666	10.7	207
4158	6554	3	The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affect the cyclist so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a desert, in mid- June, with the heat “beginning to beat down” on him. This feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water, but when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself. The cyclist began to realize that he “could trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS1, the long distance and changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling, affected him. The distance on which to cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park, consisted of hours and miles of riding. Over vast changes of terrain. The “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills”, which affected the cyclist speed and energy to finish his trip.	3	2		3																						148	7	166	11	0	0	4.648648648648648	21.142857142857142	41	22	14	3	4	25	72	11.0	8.82	7.99	22	9.2	10.06	13.0	9.6	202
4167	6563	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the “high desserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact.	3	3		3																						184	13	201	7	0	0	4.385869565217392	14.153846153846153	48	28	14	1	4	25	101	10.7	7.72	7.27	19	8.7	10.72	11.2	9.8	248
4172	6568	3	The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn’t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff	1	1		1																						52	3	56	1	0	0	4.173076923076923	17.333333333333332	11	11	3	4	1	4	29	6.9	6.32	6.92	5	6.5	7.69	8.0	6.4	65
4173	6569	3	In the cyclist’s outlook on his journey through Yosemite’s park, reader’s can get a good feel of how it might be to be riding right along side. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride. He sees such a vast variety of scenery including rivers, sandy dry deserts also, as well as cool pines and trees in the park part. He said it was also breezy which probably made for an enjoyable temperature.	1	1		1																						76	4	83	3	0	0	4.368421052631579	19.0	19	7	8	7	1	10	45	8.7	7.54	8.53	7	7.2	10.23	11.0	10.1	96
4176	6572	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off. It caused him to go dehiderated because lack of water and he went kind of dilerious. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was un drinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree. Lastly, the Welch’s factory that he came across was teasing him in in the way that he couldn’t have the liquids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch’s juice. Not only did the cyclist get off track because the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable.	3	2		3																						143	7	155	5	0	0	4.496503496503497	20.428571428571427	31	22	10	8	4	17	85	10.0	8.3	8.29	21	7.7	10.12	8.166666666666666	9.6	193
4182	6579	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self- determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths inorder to reach their destination.For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are based to reach some rough spots where it seems you can’t walk. But that is where self–determination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there @MONTH1 be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip, when you don’t have the right provision to keep you self energised you can ‘t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything.This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						145	6	160	4	0	0	4.523809523809524	24.5	36	23	6	3	4	18	89	18.3	9.35	8.05	15	15.1	16.73	14.75	13.8	203
4187	6584	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into “short, rolling hills,” These hills are increasing the difficulty and are causing him doubt that he will make it. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The horizon was what kept cyclist going. “I began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.’ The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it.	3	2		3																						154	8	168	8	0	0	4.48051948051948	19.25	37	21	9	4	4	21	91	18.9	8.6	8.62	22	15.9	17.74	18.333333333333332	12.2	208
4189	6586	3	When the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence. He biked to the first town but it was like a “ghost town.” A town is a town. soon after that, he did not see anything. No cars, buildings, or anything. He was getting sad and dehydrated. The old men swore there was a town coming up so he put his trust and confidence in him once again. He saw a building  coming up, but it was just an old wore down factory. He thought he was let down. He was sure he was going to die, right there right now. He than saw a siga for a fish comp! He was overjoyed! The place was real to! He thought of them as his savior! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously.	1	2		2																						132	15	152	5	4	0	3.962406015037594	8.866666666666667	22	20	8	11	5	22	81	2.4	3.45	6.06	11	2.5	4.99	5.75	6.7	161
4194	6591	3	When your with your family in ocean city biking down the board walk your only obstacle is people. When your in a race on whinedy roads you could have lots of obstacles. The wheather could be your greatest obstacle. You could pass out by lack of water and scorcing heat. You could fall over by slippery roads from the rain. Along with that nature could lay its toll apon you. “a ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of @NUM1, Kurmaskie) @CAPS1 like a snake you don’t know what you could come across.	1	1		1																						97	8	107	1	0	0	4.459183673469388	12.25	29	10	4	4	1	16	53	7.9	7.89	7.86	10	4.9	8.54	8.25	9.3	121
4199	6596	3	In the story the features of setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn`t going to make it. When he finally got to “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp,” he learned a lesson because when an old man asked if he know the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map.''	2	2		2																						132	6	142	4	0	0	4.212121212121212	22.0	21	27	6	7	4	12	81	9.5	6.73	7.61	12	8.3	10.25	8.5	9.3	170
4202	6599	3	First, by accepting the old mens’ advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would, easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a “ghost town”, lifeless and most importantly, waterless. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like “battery acid”. Next he rides past a “Rough Road Ahead” sign; not the most encouraging thing on his journey. To add to the despair, he has to manever his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp. “To him, this simple bait shop was like  beacon of hope from food himself.	2	3		3																						110	6	127	9	0	0	4.702702702702703	18.5	29	15	8	9	3	27	53	10.1	9.28	8.71	19	8.1	9.87	9.0	10.5	154
4207	6604	3	The setting in the begining of the story is flat an easy but as the path becomes unfamiliar it turns into many hills & turns. This effects the cyclist a lot because he was low on water & was begining to become dehydrated.	2	2		2																						43	2	45	0	0	0	4.162790697674419	21.5	10	5	5	0	3	2	24	9.4	7.49	7.73	6	10.1	11.13	12.75	0.0	62
4216	6613	3	The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water. There are obsticles in the road too, such as, the big snake laying across the middle of the road. He is lost without water and could possibly die of an heatstroke.	1	1		1																						53	4	60	3	0	0	4.283018867924528	13.25	11	8	2	3	3	8	33	5.4	5.9	6.98	6	4.9	7.58	6.375	8.1	69
4224	6621	3	"The setting that were affecting the cyclist was the lack of water he had because it says “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" and the text also says "" I’ld read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate” he wouldn’t be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasn’t thirsty."	1	1		1																						66	1	69	1	0	0	4.333333333333333	66.0	15	15	2	5	1	7	35	31.8	8.78	11.72	9	26.3	28.46	37.0	0.0	88
4225	6622	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldn’t find any building or water for many miles. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didn’t know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																						56	4	61	1	0	0	5.017857142857143	14.0	18	8	2	0	4	8	29	9.2	10.72	8.28	10	7.6	8.46	7.0	8.8	84
4237	6634	3	Well the features of the setting affects the cyclist is a lot of ways. Well when his water was is hot to drink He got some pebbles and stuck them, in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that it will dilute your spit. The terrain of the story was very rocky and hilly. Those are the features of the terrain.	1	1		1																						64	5	70	1	0	0	4.0	12.8	13	7	2	3	2	6	42	3.8	4.51	6.0	6	3.6	5.12	5.4	3.1	76

He got scared he was going to die because had he drunk all his water and he didn’t know how long it would be till he got some more. He shouldn’t have drank his water so quickly knowing he had a while to go. Then he became happy when he saw the bait sign. He biked quickly down the hill.	1	1		1																						77	5	82	0	0	0	3.8181818181818183	15.4	9	18	5	7	1	7	47	4.3	4.17	6.04	2	4.6	6.16	6.7	3.1	91
4249	6646	3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal.

4257	6654	3	In the essay “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is affect both positivly and negativly by the setting. Setting is the sounding in which the story tacks place. In the story a cyclist loses his way and band is put in to dangous because of it. The setting of the story can be dicrided as mountainous with many rolling hills. The author discride the setting by say “@CAPS1 two miles in to the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” The change in terrain made it more difical for the cyclist. However he also used the land to give him hope that he was almost their. He told him self that he’d make it if he make it over the next hill. The setting of the story gave the cyclist hope and problems in his journy to sarive.	1	1		1																						146	10	155	2	0	0	4.239726027397261	14.6	37	17	9	5	4	21	88	7.7	6.85	7.57	21	6.9	8.69	11.2	8.1	193
4259	6656	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by rush he /she got when speeding down the hill. The fresh morning air, no limits just you and your feet.

4261	6658	3	“@CAPS1 directions, June, lack of water” all are elements that effect the rider on his ride. He took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut. I turned out that their short cut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California. It would have been burning hot. Lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip. He could have died if he didn’t find the other water source. These were some elements that effected the rider on his trip.	2	2		2																						90	8	101	3	0	0	4.355555555555555	11.25	24	11	7	1	0	13	49	4.7	6.01	6.83	9	4.2	6.3	5.375	8.1	119

4271	6668	3	The cyclist had alot of problems with his setting. It was very hot and he started getting low on water. This caused him to become dehydrated. There was hardly any civilization so no one could come to his aid.

4282	6679	3	As he began his journey, he had full confidence in the directions given given to him by the old men. After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on. After he found an “ramshackle shed” he became troubled , as he “had been “hitting“ his “water bottles regularly“ and was traveling through the “desert of California in June” and was running low on water. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he “manuevered” his way down, only to find it long  deserted and himself close to despair. He was desparate for water he needed it soon. Finally, he came upon “@CAPS1 and Wilber’s Fish Camp” and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on  he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling.	2	2		2																						142	7	158	8	0	0	4.333333333333333	20.571428571428573	27	24	10	7	8	27	80	9.4	7.66	7.21	16	8.8	9.74	11.2	9.2	192
4286	6683	3	Dry, thirsty, tedious-all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, everything is dry. The cyclist isnt any where near a town that could help him. He has been pedaling in the heat, outside for a long time. Secondly, He is very thirsty. The way he is travelling is a good sign he is in need of water. He went fourty miles before he reached the first town to stop at. He also is on a bike, So that doesn’t leave him much room to carry water along. Lastly, the trip is tedious. He has been going for forty miles, and the speed limit is 55. He hasn’t acceded 12 mph. All to gether, the cyclists trip seems to be adventure that takes a lot of heart.	1	1		1																						128	12	152	9	0	0	4.1484375	10.666666666666666	29	14	10	6	1	23	73	3.5	4.62	7.25	14	3.9	5.53	4.4	7.2	162
4295	6692	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can’t go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he’s relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn’t really know where he was going because there wasn’t a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first “town” as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and he’s only 12 he knows that he’s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																						117	7	128	4	0	0	4.273504273504273	16.714285714285715	23	20	3	11	4	17	67	7.0	6.67	7.84	8	6.3	7.02	6.285714285714286	6.2	148
4306	6703	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the journey more dangerous and difficult. For example, in the reading it states that rediculously large, poisonous diamond back snakes. Blocked majority of the pavement. So, the cyclist had to keep his/her balance to ease past them. The terrian also changed into short, rolling hills, making it even more difficult.	1	1		1																						60	5	72	5	0	0	5.25	12.0	14	9	7	7	1	11	31	9.3	11.24	8.44	10	8.0	8.8	6.8	10.8	93
4308	6705	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	3		3																						230	14	263	17	0	0	4.769565217391304	16.428571428571427	61	41	11	11	6	34	128	9.3	9.28	7.26	33	7.3	8.82	6.625	9.6	328
4312	6709	3	In the story the author says, “The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.” The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water.	2	2		2																						136	8	145	4	0	0	4.125	17.0	30	25	1	7	6	13	78	9.4	6.45	7.43	17	8.6	11.14	11.2	9.7	177
4319	6716	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead” plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn’t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road.

4321	6718	3	The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a rough undergoing story about a cyclist going though rough climate and terrain. In this story the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for about as far for human eyes could see. In paragraph @NUM1 the text says “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke.” is empressed how the climate felt. This explains the heat and how he felt during this experience. This whole trip sounds suffering.	1	1		1																						89	5	95	1	0	0	4.808988764044944	17.8	25	17	4	4	3	12	42	10.1	9.8	9.13	20	7.9	9.82	10.1	9.4	124
4335	6732	3	The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story “do not exceed posted speed limit” It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California all worn down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated. It says in the essay “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a georgus day in June simply because I listend to some gentlemen.” this explains on how simply exhausted he had become due to the miles of cycling, and the beating down sun and total lack of water due to absence of all towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhausgen because of the faulty directions of the old people. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions.	2	2		2																						168	6	177	3	0	0	4.470238095238095	28.0	48	22	14	6	5	16	86	13.6	8.59	8.69	28	11.8	13.82	15.0	11.9	237

He is doing something that be lovers, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confidentin the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted.Though at first he laughs it off, he laster realizes just how much trouble he in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates.

4339	6736	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The “towns” he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldn’t get more water or a place to rest. “I was doing a water depleating @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel”. This shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																						92	5	96	0	0	0	4.413043478260869	18.4	24	15	6	2	5	10	54	10.8	8.25	8.38	14	9.9	12.24	13.5	11.2	130

The cyclist takes directions from older guys who look like they haven’t left their porches in ages. He takes their advice and he then sukkers in the long run because he cannot find water and it is a hot @DATE1. He hikes uphills in the heating sun and fears a heat stroke.

In the story, it continues to talk about lack of water. “When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery @NUM1). This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down. But a good way it affect them is pebbles. ""I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to @NUM2). This shows that even though he has no water the pebbles can make him less thirsty. This is how the setting affects the cyclist.

In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to Yosemite National Park greatlly affected the cyclist. One the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road weren’t the most comfortable to be riding on. There was nothing insight for the cyclist to see. The cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for him. The author states, “…  gaining elevation while loosing hope.” Last the weather was hot and dry which tired the cyclist out. He had no water with him and with the weather he had no energy or hope to help him through the journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																						202	13	216	1	0	0	4.463054187192118	15.615384615384615	59	23	14	10	7	18	108	8.1	7.94	6.5	20	6.3	8.11	8.5	8.8	271
4352	6749	3	I am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him. The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot & drinking his water & he would soon run out of water & dehydrate. For example in the story the cyclist would always bring up the little bit of water he had left & around the essay he talked about the dehydration he was seeing & even death. Another example is the relif he had when he drink the water from the sink. In conclusion, this is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						98	5	104	1	0	0	4.173469387755102	19.6	22	14	2	4	5	7	55	8.6	7.54	6.26	9	9.4	9.59	11.6	10.8	138
4354	6751	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states “This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town.” This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist.	2	3		3																						216	8	230	4	0	0	4.398148148148148	27.0	49	33	11	11	6	18	123	14.7	8.48	7.65	23	11.8	13.66	19.0	10.6	283
4355	6752	3	The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he’s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted.	2	2		2																						161	10	170	2	0	0	4.3105590062111805	16.1	28	23	13	13	9	12	103	12.3	7.67	7.32	12	10.2	13.45	15.0	12.5	205
4356	6753	3	The setting was very hot dry and was a desert. This setting effected him be it was making him very dehidarted and hot. It was very hard for him to go any fourther but he knew he had to keep going. Also the land was very barin and ething around. Clearlier the setting effected the biker.	1	1		1																						56	5	61	0	0	0	4.125	11.2	8	10	5	6	4	10	36	3.6	4.97	6.17	5	4.1	6.62	5.4	8.2	73
4362	6759	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they don’t ride as much anymore and don’t know the best routes to take. So they just take their old routes, thinking they are still the better way, but when they use them they realize how tiring and bad they are.	1	1		1																						50	2	54	2	0	0	4.36	25.0	7	8	5	6	3	5	30	11.6	7.84	8.03	7	8.3	10.8	13.0	0.0	61
4363	6760	3	“At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..” being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel. The sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point. The sign that said “Rough @CAPS1 ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” had to be intimidating. Considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast. Those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office. yes like the writer said “the world is a fluid place.  Things  change.” The old men probably had close to no due what they were talking about considering things have changed since @NUM1 (when carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, must have been rather intimidating. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more. In eseance I think the setting was a major part why the cyclist felt that way	3	2		3																						165	11	184	3	0	0	4.299401197604791	15.181818181818182	34	27	10	10	3	23	92	9.3	7.14	6.95	17	7.8	9.45	11.0	8.8	213
4366	6763	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. When she was riding it was very hot this caused the cyclist to lose energy and dehydrate. Also when the cyclist went through a terrain change. The road changed into rolling hills. This caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired. Also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water. Eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated. This whole situation implied to stick to your original plan. If the cyclist would have done that she wouldn’t have had to go through the hardships.	2	2		2																						109	9	118	0	0	0	4.568807339449541	12.11111111111111	22	19	7	6	3	10	64	6.1	7.87	6.99	12	5.6	7.41	5.333333333333333	8.2	149
4368	6765	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist’s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he @MONTH1 not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let  down for the cyclist’s mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned.	2	3		3																						121	7	136	5	0	0	5.0	17.428571428571427	28	16	10	10	10	17	61	10.9	10.9	9.06	23	8.9	9.9	10.166666666666666	11.2	179
4374	6771	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the speaker is biking through some rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention long distances. He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen” (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey.	2	2		2																						134	6	148	5	0	0	4.835820895522388	22.333333333333332	41	17	13	5	3	17	62	12.5	10.39	8.98	27	9.6	11.91	11.6	11.2	190
4376	6773	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						87	5	94	0	0	0	4.057471264367816	17.4	19	13	3	2	5	6	52	6.4	5.57	6.13	5	5.4	6.96	7.9	5.7	106

4393	6790	3	In the story ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting seemed to affect the main character (the cyclist) very much during his pedal, for example, whole the dry desert setting made him think that he could survive with out water, he became dehydrated. The first town, with @NUM1 degree watter could not satisfy his standards. The old velches June factory, was all run down, and is no longer in business, much like the desert, just old barren unuseland.

4394	6791	3	There are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist. One feature is that it is getting hotter and it will eventually effect him. The line “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirge.” shows that the heat  might be starting to effect him. Another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water. The line “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says “and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated. Those are some of the many features that effect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						155	10	166	1	0	0	4.160256410256411	15.6	34	21	8	5	4	15	93	6.9	6.2	6.93	14	6.5	8.17	8.0	8.5	207

This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, ”I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.” @CAPS1 feature of the setting was the desolet towns that didn’t contain any water. This lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to sucking on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulates. @CAPS1 features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch’s Grape factory. This  factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state. The narrator called the factory.”Ironic  twist.”	3	3		3																						160	8	173	4	0	0	4.4753086419753085	20.25	43	26	12	3	3	20	87	11.3	8.65	8.23	21	8.7	11.16	10.8	10.3	215
4431	6828	3	The features of the setting could affect this cyclist. In this case it do effect the cyclist.

4435	6832	3	In the short story, Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting effects the cyclist in the story. For example, the dry hot air begins to  slowly dehidrate him, causing the cyclist to lose all sense of reason, the heat also played tricks on his mind. Also, the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them. This, also with the heat factor, caused him to use up his much needed water supply.

4445	6842	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. The speed limit sign makes him feel like life is cruel. His first glimpse of the welch's Juice factory makes him feel excited. Meeting the deserted fork in the road makes him feel troubled. When he finally gets there, he feels relieved. These are all examples showing that features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																						63	6	71	1	0	0	4.841269841269841	10.5	17	13	6	2	0	7	28	6.6	8.56	7.92	10	5.0	6.1	5.25	8.8	88
4447	6844	3	The features setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn’t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and how much he could ride.	1	1		1																						120	6	127	1	0	0	4.391666666666667	20.0	26	17	5	8	3	10	78	9.2	7.83	6.73	12	8.7	8.67	11.0	9.3	166
4453	6850	3	Hot, terrain, middle of nowhere- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the hot weather in California made the cyclist thirsty and almost dehydrated. There was no place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad and warm. Second, the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere. He couldn’t get water to hydrate himself or to sit down and rest.	2	1		2																						82	6	94	6	0	0	4.646341463414634	13.666666666666666	17	12	8	8	6	14	47	7.3	8.17	6.43	8	6.3	6.94	6.666666666666667	8.3	115
4460	6857	3	The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be “There was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is “wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who haden’t been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly.	2	2		2																						160	5	173	7	0	0	4.6625	32.0	42	18	7	6	5	15	95	16.5	9.93	8.48	26	13.4	14.55	11.4	11.6	226
4462	6859	3	The settings and features are very important to cyclists one because water and food try might carry a waterbottle and a snack but they need to know  where they are going and if they will need to bring extra or not. In the story I just read he didn’t bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble. Its important that a cyclist knows where their going and whats around them so they don't get lost and have no acsess to food or water.	2	1		2																						94	4	100	0	0	0	4.021052631578947	23.75	16	15	3	4	10	7	63	13.3	6.57	7.2	7	12.0	13.37	17.0	9.7	119
4471	6868	3	The setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first place he arrived at was a “ghost town” Then he reach a water pump about twenty miles up the road. The water was very hot and tasted very nasty. The text states, “…water feeting somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees…when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. Then he had to travel without water and became dehydrated. Travelling up and down hills he thought he began to imaginate a building that could possibly provide he with water. The building was there but it was abandoned. He decide he was going to such on a couple of pebbles. The text says, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thrist…”	2	2		2																						134	10	148	3	0	0	4.262773722627737	13.7	32	22	7	10	5	20	77	6.6	6.95	7.67	17	5.6	7.45	7.142857142857142	8.2	175
4476	6873	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” the cyclist sees many different settings when he left it was early summer and it was pretty hot outside. He rode into the morning when would make him tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town so that means he could rest get his supplies. Then he arrive by cool pines and rushing river which probably makes him feel releaxed. Then he showed up at a ramshack shed with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldn’t hold in the lamest made. Gated men which people made him feel uncocleible, and the pumps did not give him water so that was nobody also pointing. Then he was rideing through the California deserts in June witch probably made him more dehirrated.	2	2		2																						132	8	140	1	0	0	4.462121212121212	16.5	27	24	12	9	4	13	73	9.0	8.24	7.92	17	7.1	8.77	7.833333333333334	8.8	175
4481	6878	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist. It was a hot June day and the water supplies he had was running out. He got the wrong directions homThese old men so he would had to ride  his bike longer than he had to and he would need water from pedaling all that way for nothing. Since he was going in the wrong direction there were no buildings for him to get water, there were no people so he couldn’t communicate and there would be no one to call for help incase he was over heated from the heat.	2	2		2																						108	5	114	1	0	0	4.08256880733945	21.8	24	17	5	3	3	11	66	11.4	6.56	7.75	13	10.3	12.65	14.0	10.1	140
4500	6897	3	The dessert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, their would be no refills because the pump was only giving “ tarlike substance” said the text. With the lack of water dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the “ ridiculously large snake” he had seen. A finale effect would be mirages that could loose your judgement. This man double checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by “[wipping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage,” Through all the toughest desser obsticles the character was able to take the short cut and survive heat, dehydration, and animals of the dessert.	2	2		2																						137	7	152	6	0	0	4.700729927007299	19.571428571428573	37	17	10	4	3	22	71	10.5	9.28	8.18	24	8.6	10.18	7.142857142857142	10.3	193
4502	6899	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very sevior situation. The cyclist was in a desert. Like terria, which was not dinsely populated on his trail, there was a lack of fresh water supplys, and the tempatures is more extreme. The cyclist could easily have faintid from heatstroke, due to the lack of water and excessive heat and work that his was doing peatling. Had the area been more populated, he would have had more chances to stock up on water greatly indecriasing his risk of heat stroke. There was also the snakes which presentid danger for him, has he been bitting then he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the closet help which could proven fetal. Had the setting been, say a city park, on a populated country side, them thi setting would had provided exponeutaly loss prodioms and dangers for the cyclist.	3	2		3																						154	7	171	10	0	0	4.62987012987013	22.0	43	15	12	9	4	26	89	11.4	8.88	8.73	26	9.5	12.44	10.166666666666666	11.8	218
4503	6900	3	The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says “and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June”. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says “I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul”. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.	2	2		2																						94	3	100	3	0	0	4.505263157894737	31.666666666666668	20	18	3	3	5	11	51	15.7	9.47	8.91	14	13.0	15.41	18.333333333333332	12.5	134
4506	6903	3	On the cyclists rideto Yosemite National Park he encouters a lot of hardships due to the setting hes around and the advice given by oldmen. The cyclist riding his bike in the middle of June in the deserts of california isnt good to begin with adding to cyclist dehydration state. He first come to encouters ''one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn`t hold in the lament mule'' By that description oF his lecatracy it seems as if he might be in ghost town by himself almost could strand him. He described the terrain with “short, rolling hils.'' and ''over one long, crippling hill.'' This shows some of the obstacle that he had to go through in a bike, just to get to Yosemite National Park. He @CAPS1 realized once he encounterd these Features oF the terrain that he was oFF track and needed to find help. After his survival of his surroundings For as long as he could go, @CAPS1 gets help at a real camp. That is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist epidemic.	2	2		2																						184	10	206	6	0	0	4.4728260869565215	18.4	53	21	9	9	4	24	106	11.1	8.07	8.98	27	8.7	11.37	14.0	10.1	243
4513	6911	3	The setting of this story affects the cyclist alot. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run-down out of dated town which didnt help him when he was lost. The town is out of date and hot. Which bring another problem, the cyclist was dehydrating because he didnt have enough water. He would hilusinate and see things that werent there. He become very tired in the hot sun. So the setttling in this short stories effected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																						85	7	98	1	0	0	4.411764705882353	12.142857142857142	18	13	7	4	2	11	53	5.4	6.83	6.84	11	4.5	5.78	5.5	6.9	112
4515	6913	3	The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat smoot terrain, when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. The biker said “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot. he was sweating and getting dehydrated, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst.” he had eighteen miles to next town without much water. The first deserted town didn’t have any drinkable water. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going.	2	2		2																						119	8	132	5	0	0	4.3277310924369745	14.875	24	25	13	5	3	16	64	7.5	6.78	8.19	14	6.4	8.14	6.571428571428571	8.0	151
4517	6915	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn’t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn’t have been so worried. What’s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn’t have struggled so much at the end. “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.	2	3		3																						186	8	196	0	0	0	4.577540106951871	23.375	43	24	7	12	7	18	108	13.5	9.23	8.27	26	11.3	13.01	11.0	11.5	255
4518	6916	3	The features  of the setting affect the cyclist in that it made him use up his water supply and tested his determination. “ Sometimes life can be so cruel” implies that he was having a horrible time coping with the setting he was in. To himself he thought be was gonna die at any moment.	1	1		1																						55	3	60	0	0	0	4.160714285714286	18.666666666666668	13	10	1	1	1	6	33	12.2	7.14	7.87	9	11.7	12.45	14.75	0.0	77
4528	6926	3	”Do not Exceed the posted speed limit” tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of “the serenity of an early summer evening,” and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the “town” he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclist’s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.	3	3		3																						222	10	248	13	0	0	4.709821428571429	22.4	65	40	13	6	12	30	105	13.2	9.93	8.99	41	11.7	12.94	9.0	12.1	326
4532	6930	3	The complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story. His trip goes from bad to worse as he progresses to Yosemite. After taking directions from the “old codgers,” the author attempts the shortcut, but is dissapointed. He arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted. He rubbed it off though, and kept “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” as his motivation. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued. Just as if things couldn’t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope. He became even more of a pessimist when “a ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavement…” He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned. He even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration. When he finally found the fish camp, he was relieved. All the obstacles he prospered through were worth in the end.	2	1		2																						189	13	212	12	0	0	4.626315789473685	14.615384615384615	39	33	13	9	11	31	103	8.3	8.64	7.85	30	7.1	9.49	7.428571428571429	9.9	267
4539	6937	3	The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main charater is biking throug a desert in the summer with little water. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will sarley die. The main character says, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main characters energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main characters biggest problem is the heat of the setting.	2	2		2																						131	8	141	3	0	0	4.694656488549619	16.375	37	15	12	2	3	14	64	10.0	9.46	8.06	22	8.2	9.62	8.666666666666666	10.9	189
4541	6939	3	All the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strerigth. It seems like he might have collapsed it he hadn't thought he was going to @CAPS1, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him.	2	2		2																						92	6	108	7	0	0	4.141304347826087	15.333333333333334	18	14	3	3	3	13	62	5.7	5.1	7.31	11	5.7	7.86	7.333333333333334	7.8	118
4546	6944	3	In the story “Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting seem negative to the cyclist. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next @NUM1 miles easily. For example the cyclist says “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, “the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aern’t going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist later on the cyclist ends up saying “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you.	2	3		3																						164	9	174	2	0	0	4.347560975609756	18.22222222222222	36	31	13	6	2	20	88	10.8	7.78	8.36	23	8.9	11.07	13.75	9.2	218
4554	6952	3	At times when the features of the setting are bad it can have a great impact on the cyclist. For one if it’s too hot the cyclist is going to need plenty of water if he/she does'nt want to be dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat strokes and deadly snakes, cyclist might want to avoid that. When your a cyclist times can be hard just prepared for the long run.	1	1		1																						72	4	79	1	0	0	4.125	18.0	17	10	6	3	1	7	42	7.0	5.8	7.38	8	6.8	7.76	8.25	6.0	91

4576	6974	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first “town”, and described it as only having “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall” I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldn’t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist."	1	1		1																						180	5	206	17	0	0	4.733333333333333	36.0	49	27	18	8	8	33	89	18.8	9.88	8.84	24	15.0	15.73	18.666666666666668	12.0	256
4582	6980	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, “They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey.	1	1		1																						55	3	62	2	0	0	5.381818181818182	18.333333333333332	17	8	2	1	3	8	28	13.1	13.11	9.71	12	9.2	10.23	10.833333333333334	10.5	81
4583	6981	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit “the cyclist has some very rough obstacles on his way to Yosemite National park. With his lack of water and diredness he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black. He easily passes the snake and moves on. Being in the intense heat and with know water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he go's this way is because @NUM1 “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office”. These guys gave him wrong directions. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other stuff wouldn’t have happened if he payed attention to his surroundings and people around him.	2	2		2																						133	6	143	0	0	0	4.443609022556391	22.166666666666668	36	16	6	6	6	15	74	9.0	8.01	8.5	17	7.2	9.4	10.8	9.6	177
4584	6982	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch’s Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water $ be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of liFe or building. Therefore his surrouding throughout the story make him indifferent, confident & relieved.	3	2		3																						140	8	152	4	0	0	4.735714285714286	17.5	41	16	10	4	3	14	72	9.8	9.68	8.38	26	8.9	10.4	7.857142857142858	11.2	207
4588	6986	3	The setting in the short story; “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit” greatly affects the cyclist. The rough terrain and blazing sun test him and make him suffer in ways he never imagined. One point, after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes, “Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” this setting has caused the cyclist to become so dehydrated that he can’t think. The cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him. As you can see the setting has a very strong affect on the cyclist.	2	3		3																						109	6	121	3	0	0	4.336363636363636	18.333333333333332	26	20	6	6	2	17	56	8.3	7.25	7.73	13	6.8	7.65	7.5	5.5	140

4597	6995	3	The features like not enough water not enough sense of direction, effect the cyclist because he needs water to keep on peadiling. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going. From not enough water he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and there been sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that pargraph” That site ment that the old man’s sense of directin was out of date. They did not no where any thing was at just there in giant poarch.	1	1		1																						112	5	121	4	0	0	4.223214285714286	22.4	27	16	11	3	4	13	63	9.6	7.03	7.29	11	8.5	9.67	13.75	8.8	140
4603	7001	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all I think that when the cyclist came across the “ghost town” he felt alone and discouraged. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was. Overall I think that it had really physical and psycoligical effects on him.	2	2		2																						133	6	139	0	0	0	4.120300751879699	22.166666666666668	18	25	11	10	6	8	87	9.1	6.38	6.64	13	8.4	10.38	10.8	9.3	170
4610	7008	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try  forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were “I was going to die.” First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp. Her setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive.	1	1		1																						110	9	121	1	0	0	4.5675675675675675	12.333333333333334	29	16	6	8	4	15	64	6.3	7.93	6.97	12	4.5	5.97	5.75	6.9	147
4625	7023	3	In the poem “Do not exceed speed limit” the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake” This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.	1	1		1																						99	6	106	0	0	0	4.14	16.666666666666668	24	15	7	6	3	14	49	10.6	6.85	7.26	11	9.4	11.13	13.125	8.1	125
4628	7026	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was “traveling through the high desert of California in June” this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal.	2	3		3																						141	7	155	8	0	0	4.4822695035460995	20.142857142857142	32	19	13	6	4	22	79	9.7	8.12	7.88	22	7.6	10.88	11.2	10.3	188
4642	7040	3	The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit” affect the cyclist. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as “a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.” The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, “The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large” snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn’t give up and is relieved when he finally receives water.	3	3		3																						203	11	226	12	0	0	4.945812807881773	18.454545454545453	55	28	12	8	6	30	103	12.0	10.68	8.61	37	10.0	10.48	7.7142857142857135	11.0	299
4643	7041	3	The features of the desert changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. When the road began the change, the speaker’s determination did too, “Flat road were replaced by short hills”. The terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut. “I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listned to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades”. The heat in desert made the speaker thirsty causing him to drink all his water. There was no source of water therefore he decided to suckenc-stone. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst”,. But the bumpy terrain didn’t allow him to do that. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker began to panice, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”. But luckily the author thoughts changed after he found a supply of water, the features did affect the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																						175	9	190	5	0	0	4.571428571428571	19.444444444444443	51	32	5	7	5	22	91	9.8	8.65	7.94	20	7.3	8.67	10.6	7.8	228
4649	7047	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn’t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn’t in a “ghost town”, with the, “sun beggining to beat down”. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, “about forty miles into the petal”, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot.	2	2		2																						115	7	128	7	1	0	4.104347826086957	16.428571428571427	27	10	9	9	4	21	70	6.1	5.45	7.61	10	5.0	7.6	7.833333333333334	6.9	141

4652	7050	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for “rough road ahead,” @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging.	3	3		3																						117	11	133	7	0	0	5.2905982905982905	10.636363636363637	31	19	8	8	2	21	57	9.3	11.23	8.81	27	7.9	10.49	6.444444444444445	11.6	188
4654	7052	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																						87	6	93	0	0	0	4.172413793103448	14.5	18	9	6	5	5	5	54	5.5	5.91	5.99	6	5.4	6.26	6.916666666666667	7.8	114
4658	7056	3	"After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,”water-deplating” one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as “rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrator’s hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally."	2	3		3																						113	8	129	6	0	0	4.778761061946903	14.125	28	18	4	9	5	16	62	9.2	9.34	7.79	17	8.4	9.27	8.666666666666666	10.6	164
4662	7060	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of no where, he couldn’t get any water. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,” he was so thirsty that he barely had any energy to keep going, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” it was hot out and he had no water so this affected his energy.	1	1		1																						75	3	80	4	0	0	4.293333333333333	25.0	16	14	3	3	1	10	46	17.5	7.67	8.87	9	14.4	16.6	20.75	0.0	98
4664	7062	3	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him.	1	1		1																						65	6	74	3	0	0	4.2	10.833333333333334	13	6	3	6	3	9	43	3.8	5.08	6.6	6	2.8	5.55	4.75	6.4	79
4665	7063	3	The setting desented in the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer’s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.	2	2		2																						127	8	143	6	0	0	4.622047244094488	15.875	34	16	7	4	4	21	70	8.3	8.47	7.91	20	6.0	9.51	8.5	9.5	170
4668	7066	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advise from people that no longer drive or even leave of the porch would be unuseful. When the author say “old timers who haven’t lest the confined of them porches since carter was in office” that what he is explaining. He then say “I rode  into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face” he was refering back to how hes  on the rode  alone riding the bike and theres not a car insight any where around. The curbs of the turns where so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safe as he did “He whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn’t mirage and tried not get to excited” @CAPS1 in this situation would have made many people excited about the long lonely cicle by his self.	2	2		2																						151	4	160	0	0	0	4.162337662337662	38.5	32	22	9	11	4	15	93	17.4	7.61	8.54	15	14.5	16.44	13.5	11.2	194

I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip.

4678	7076	3	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If it’s too hot, you’re going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If it’s all down hill, it’s really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out.

4680	7078	3	The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist. First, it is a very hot dry in June.

4683	7081	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because at first he had to watch out for the snakes that usually crossed the roads, then the streets were crooked and bumpy, so the road structure throw him off a bit, and he was riding his bike in June and it was very hot, and he had lack of water so he thought he was going to have a heatstroke.

""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" The cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is ""troubling."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic. Farther down the road, the terrain of the road changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name."" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting @NUM1.

''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn`t been off their porch in decades.''

4741	7139	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June.Their is also a lack of water, some must pace his sips carefully. Therefore also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life.  The dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey.

Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town “I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.’ This quote means that he wasn’t expecting hills, he thought it was going o be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features.	2	1		2																						123	8	138	3	0	0	4.390243902439025	15.375	29	23	7	2	1	14	63	8.0	7.31	8.49	17	6.6	8.34	10.8	8.0	162
4753	7151	3	The setting in the story was the “high deserts of California in June.” At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldn’t make it he saw a sign that said “Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp” He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” and “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” So this brought self doubting behavior.	3	3		3																						261	14	274	0	0	0	4.088122605363985	18.642857142857142	56	44	19	12	13	23	145	8.7	6.09	7.5	21	7.1	9.64	8.0	8.3	325

Below the mooring mast would be several other buildings were other people worked and lived. If something happened while he dirigible was attempting to dock, it could take out the building and the lives of the people in it. Not only that, but below were the city streets, where pedestrians walked. In paragraphs @NUM2, the passage also talks about the stress of a heavy, steel framed airship mooring at the top of the building. The frame would need to be very dense and, as the architects of the project discovered expensive. Other safety issues include the high winds that would drift the dirigibles off course, and the safety of dirigibles themselves.

Alsoif  the blimp was moving, how would passangers get on and off? They could fall off the loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp.

8973	14923	6	In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and could cause the dirigible to swerve. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be unsafe. At any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. Which could also cause harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																						168	12	191	11	0	0	4.7976190476190474	14.0	47	22	12	7	5	19	92	8.2	9.16	7.71	29	6.4	8.7	7.2857142857142865	10.3	243

9011	14961	6	In the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, obsticals of the Empire State Building faced to attempemt to allow dirigibles to dock there were enginering challenges. A problem with the docking was that the building was complete before the idea came to mind. A second problem was that the whole skeletal structure had to be changed in order for dirigibles to be able to dock. Then the question on how the airships, dirigibles, would stay next to the building. These were harder problem after it was illigale to have dirigibles to be close to buildings as well. Plus the fact that if they crash they are flamable and could kill people. Those are some facts that made it difficult for the Empire State building to build a dirigibles docks in the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.	3	3		3																						141	7	155	7	0	0	4.702127659574468	20.142857142857142	42	16	10	4	2	17	77	10.8	9.4	7.66	22	8.8	9.74	11.6	10.0	201

This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for Dirigibles.In building the mooring mast, came obstacles. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth. Lead weights were typically used to keep from swaying, but if used here, lead weights would be dangling @NUM1 ft above pedestrians heads. Which leads to safety being another obstacle. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable, if ignited, the possibly largest accident would occur to New York City. The Final obstacle is the law. There is a law that states ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas."" Which would make the mooring mast's purpose illegal.

9105	15055	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's back and to blow sideways and puncture on the tops of other buildings. On top of that, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked or collapsed the building and its foundation. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease production of the mast, because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers.	2	3		3																						118	5	131	6	0	0	5.11864406779661	23.6	35	14	9	9	5	12	62	14.5	12.07	9.89	26	11.3	14.86	13.0	13.7	180

In order to make New York City the most modern city for travel, Al Smith attempted to put a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. They did finish constructing the mooring mast, although the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened. The stress of the people boarding the dirigible could cause damage to the original framework. Once it was finished, there were @NUM1 attempts the board passengers onto the blimps. Although, they both ended in failure. The builders were not able to overcome the obstacles of the severe winds and laws. Winds could blow the blimp strayed into another building. Also, if a dirigible made of hydrogen was used, it could cause a fatal accident due to the high flammability of it. Finally, there was an existing law that airships from flying close to urban areas.

9144	15094	6	Based on the excerpt from the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in building the mooring mast. For example, there was actually a law that prohibited exactly what the builders wanted. The law said that airships could not fly too low over city areas. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building would directly violate that law when the ships come in to dock. Another problem the builders faced was the danger surrounding the airships that would be docking there. The airships, called dirigibles, were like giant balloons and could pop if they touched something sharp enough. The Empire State Building was surrounded by other extremely tall buildings and most of them had long spires on top. Therefore, if the dirigible bumps one of these spires, it could pop and go plummeting to the ground. This presented another problem. Had an airship popped in New York City, it could've killed a large number of people not only in it, but on the ground. During the time of building, the Hindenburg crashed into fields, killing all of it's passengers. The builders thought what the consequences would be if that had happened in the city. This was the final straw for the builders as they abandoned their lofty goal, because of too many problems.	3	4		4																						222	13	248	11	0	0	4.8558558558558556	17.076923076923077	63	31	13	10	4	23	121	10.0	9.92	7.97	35	7.6	9.9	9.0	10.0	305

The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast.

As the author points out, there were many problems with this idea. The reasons were: safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If a dirigibles burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be violent and unpredicting. This would make it difficult to land at the mooring station and if it successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigibles would be blown around by the wind. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city. This law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into city. With all of these problems, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively."	3	4		4																						226	12	252	9	0	0	4.84070796460177	18.833333333333332	59	26	16	10	3	23	129	10.8	10.15	7.59	34	8.3	10.19	10.166666666666666	10.5	324
9286	15236	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles while trying to build the mast. One problem was that there was a lot of pressure and stress that would be put on the building if a dirigible was to dock there. This was because of the high wind speeds and of the sheer size of the dirigible. The designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework to account for the pressure. Another obstacle was that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that the dirigibles would not be allowed to even get close to the building, let alone dock on it. Eventually, these obstacles and other safety issues, such as hydrogen inside, the blimp being highly flammable, caused the idea to dissappear.	3	2		3																						138	7	151	5	0	0	4.666666666666667	19.714285714285715	33	18	10	8	3	12	82	10.4	9.23	8.16	23	8.6	10.49	8.5	10.6	195

Their dream put New York on the forefront of modern travel never was fulfilled.     First, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework because of the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, which would add stress to the frame. However, one of the greatest obstacles the builders encountered was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable and could be very dangerous, especially in highly populated areas such as New York. Also, the violent winds on top of the building made it impossible to keep the dirigibles stable and not swiveling around the mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down dirigibles that moored in the field, but this would be unsafe dangling from a building. Finally the idea violated a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All of the contributing obstacles the builders faced made their dream of using the mooring mast for dirigibles unsuccessful.	4	4		4																						186	9	207	9	0	0	5.064171122994653	20.77777777777778	56	24	14	12	4	21	98	14.1	11.78	8.61	36	11.2	12.55	12.8	13.2	288

It was the practice at the time to control the back of the dirigible with lead weights but over a civilian area this was ""neither practical nor safe.""Another important reason why the builders faced obstacles was the already existing law that prohibited low-flying aircraft over cities.

9362	15312	6	The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable The death toll would be astronaumical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are to many obstacles prohibiting it.	3	3		3																						164	9	176	4	0	0	4.932926829268292	18.22222222222222	50	18	14	9	3	14	84	10.9	10.85	8.29	31	10.4	11.67	11.5	13.0	257

9380	15330	6	four main obstacles prevented dirigibles from ever docking at the Empire State Building. The first was that a much more complex mooring mast would have to be installed on top of the Empire State Building, a very different mast than the regular masts found in open field docking areas. When a dirigible would dock on the mast cause great stress to the building's frame, a problem that could be solved by increasing the strength of the steel frame. Another problem was that a dirigible was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode. Engineers saw this would cause large problems over a densly populated area like, New York City. Once the mast was built a new problem arised, even if the dirigible could dock the intense winds could make the back end of the dirigible move violently, or cause an airship to be unable to dock, like the inncodent with the Los Angeles. Nor could they use lead weights to weigh down the ballon since they would be a danger to civilians. Lastly, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas could have prevented docking. These reasons made it impossible for a ship to ever moor on top of the Empire state Building, although two ships got very close.	4	4		4																						213	9	231	8	0	0	4.63849765258216	23.666666666666668	60	27	18	13	4	18	111	12.3	9.41	8.3	33	10.2	11.92	12.4	11.6	295

This created lots of unnecessary work for the workers, as well as made obstacles.There was also a lot of danger associated with docking dirigibles that the builders had to deal with. The violent changing air currents would require them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the movement of the dirigibles. Finally the builders find out the biggest obstacle which is that it is legal for airships to fly that low over urban areas, so technically they weren't even allowed to do what they did.

They had to put in sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to its framework. Also having the right equipment on the dirigibles served as a problem. The dirigibles didn't have the right docking tools to dock on this newly built mooring mast. The back of the dirigibles could also be swung back and forth when docked which also served as a issue When it came to docking.

The stress of the blimps load, and wind pressure had to have been sent all the way to the base of the building which was @DATE1 ft. below. Another problem that aroused later was that other blimps outside the United States were made w/hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flamable. Now since the German blimp, the Hindenburg, blew up by fire over @CAPS1, New Jersey, architectes are now worried that it will be a bad idea to do this b/c if it happened over @LOCATION3 city then many more lives would be in danger. Also yet another obstacle came up due to nature itself. The winds @ the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent wind currents. Even if the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the rear end of the blimp would be all over the place. Thats why now, blimps dock on the ground and are held down by weights on @NUM1 sides. One other reason that this is a problem is that docking a blimp @ the Empire State Building would be illegal due to the case that it is flying to low to the ground.

Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it illegal.

So with that they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building yet until they did some major adjustments. With that big problem the builders next obstacle was to design and build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.

The first obstacle was concern of public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable element. An accident in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic. The second obstacle were the violent winds on top of the building. Using lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not practical, because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A mishap would send those heavy weights flying down and causing destruction. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

For example: ""Most dirgibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium"" (paragraph @NUM1) This was dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for some reason an accident occurred, it could be catastrophic over a densely populated city like New York. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a constant powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building creates. If a dirigible docked there, it would be blowing all over the place, if it could even dock at all. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights in the back, but this would be too dangerous to try over a city teeming with people. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""

9501	15451	6	When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the buildings framework. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																						137	8	149	3	0	0	4.751824817518248	17.125	41	16	11	3	3	10	77	9.5	9.45	7.83	25	7.6	10.05	9.0	10.4	193
9508	15458	6	The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building definitely faced some large and overwhelming complications when trying to build it to allow the dockings of dirigibles, or blimps. First off, from their original plan, right off the bat, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building was taller. so they had to come up with something fast to fix that. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, @LOCATION1 had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against it, so the whole idea was basically tossed. And to make matters worse, the violent gusts of air and updrafts wouldn't make docking on the Empire State Building very safe for passengers.	2	2		2																						125	5	140	9	0	0	4.928	25.0	30	16	12	9	6	16	70	17.4	11.15	9.1	26	14.3	17.96	22.333333333333332	15.6	186

9515	15465	6	The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.	3	3		3																						257	15	272	1	0	0	4.669260700389105	17.133333333333333	63	37	17	14	4	15	146	9.1	9.16	7.62	37	7.6	9.33	7.7142857142857135	10.5	364

After the hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would of been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as @CAPS1 (paragraph @NUM2).  It wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though.  Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast.  The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on it's back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because of the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph @NUM3).  The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place.

Another obstacle to allow dirigibles was the mast; an obstacle of the mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern was safety, nature itself, and the existing laws of airships. Safety is a major factor when constructing. The builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium. Risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is. Later realizing how bad it could of been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937. Could of happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, because the winds on top were shifting constantly. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around, aswell around the mooring mast. The final obatoce was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, and puncture the dirigible's shell. In two failed attemps they desided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."""	4	4		4																						224	13	258	6	0	0	5.022321428571429	17.23076923076923	63	30	16	11	2	29	114	10.8	10.67	9.21	51	8.8	10.45	7.0	11.1	336
9576	15526	6	The building of the Empire State building was a project which faced many obstacles. Due to the additional plan of building a mooring mast at the top of the building, A series of challenges and possibilities were forced to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the addition of a mooring mast to the top of the building, would significantly weigh down the building, adding stress to its frame. Because of this, over @MONEY1 worth modifications would have to be made to enforc the building's frame and stabilize it is a whole. Laws and regulations about how high airships could hoover over urban areas also restricted the use of the mast as because the building was located in the middle of a city, a densely populated area with thousands of pedestrians below, it was clearly neither practical, nor safe. Furthermore, Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the success of the mast as because many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, this risked a fire hazzard. Lastly, strong winds and violent air currents all in all prevented the construction of the mast, as using the top of the building as a dock for airships maybe just a bit far fetched.	4	4		4																						199	7	219	12	0	0	4.834170854271357	28.428571428571427	59	18	13	13	6	19	111	15.5	10.45	9.41	44	13.2	15.78	11.8	13.3	298

9595	15545	6	Although they made a valiant effort to make a seemingly ingenious idea into reality, the obstacles faced by the constructors of the Empire State Building in creating a dock for dirigibles proved to be insurmountable. One of the challenges faced by the builders was the tumutuous winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These forceful gales made it virtually impossible to manuever a dirigable at that elevation, much less dock it to a building. Another barrier that the architects faced was the fact that there was a law saying that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas. This meant that it would be even illegal for any dirigable even come close to the Empire State Building. Finally, the creators of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of safety: @CAPS1 are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a density populated urban area would have horrific results.	3	3		3																						158	6	169	4	0	0	4.987341772151899	26.333333333333332	43	20	13	11	1	13	82	15.2	11.49	9.54	37	12.4	15.84	16.75	14.8	244

9607	15557	6	When building the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, architects faced many obstacles, such as spontaneous combustion, nature, and airship related laws. The first issue faced by builders was spontaneous combustion. Due to the accidental fire on the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible lit up on their building, the results would be even worse, for debris would fall on the busy New York streets. A second issue builders faced was mother nature herself. Because of violent air currents, the winds above the building were constantly changing. Is would mean that even if docked and tethered, the back of the ship would still spin. Normally, lead weights held down dirigibles in fields, but over New York City would be dangerous for they could snap off and fall to the pedestrians below. Finally, there were laws set in place regulating airship flight that held back construction. These laws set a limit on heights above urban areas, making a dock to the Empire State building, or even just approaching it, illegal. Builders of the mast on the Empire State building faced many obstacles during construction, such as fires, nature, and the law.	3	3		3																						198	10	226	18	0	0	5.02020202020202	19.8	65	24	18	9	6	25	95	12.1	11.02	7.97	31	8.7	11.56	10.5	12.0	285

A dirigible floating in the middle of a largely populated area would be very unsafe.  Also a dirigible is made of hydrogen and helium and hydrogen is very flammable.  So if an accident happens and a dirigible was destroyed, people below would be dead.  Another obstacle was the law, Airships cannot fly too low over urban areas.  The greatest obsticle of them all though was nature itself The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

Because of the winds in New York, the dirigible would not be secured well, and many dirigibles would be destroyed instead of held in place. Lastly, there was the reason of the law. It the excerpt it explained that, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

The dirigibles were docked which meant that the electric winch, in which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast.

In new York City, there was a lack of suitable landing areas for the dirigibles. Now this would be a good idea for the Empire State Building. Landing on the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or other services. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The dirigible is thousand-foot long. It would add stress to the building's frame. Engineers soon designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. The mast had four wings at its corners. The building is now 102 floors. Floors @NUM1 and 102 were for the observation area to double as the boarding area for the dirigible passengers. Workers celebrate framing the entire building after two months. Now people lost their hope. It's because the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never to fulfill its purpose.

9694	15644	6	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Safety was a huge issue. Foreign derigibles often used hydrogen gas to stay aloft, which is highly flammable. A fire posed a dangerous threat in such a densely populated area as New York City. Another great obstacle was the turbulent wind at the elevation of the mooring mast, which would have prevented the dirigible from staying in one place. This would make it extremely difficult for passengers to safely board or exit the zeppelin. One way to solve this problem would be to weigh down the blimp with lead weights, but this was also a dangerous practice, because the weights could fall to the ground and crush those passing by. Although a mooring mast was in theory, a useful idea, it was neither safe nor practical.	3	3		3																						144	8	159	7	0	0	4.791666666666667	18.0	36	17	15	9	5	16	74	10.1	9.63	8.92	29	9.1	11.64	8.428571428571429	11.9	210

Because hydrogen is highly flammable there would be no way that would be safe. The building could catch of fire and be a danger for all.

The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents couldnt allow dirigibles to be on the Empire State Building because you can't have dirigibles with violent air currents. It isnt safe. Lastly, laws was an obstacle the builders had to face: Lüsted's knowledge is, ""The other practical lesson why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The law was a huge obstacle for the builders building the dirigibles. Because you can't build something with it being against the law.

It could not be dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance had to be done to the frame. A third problem they had was tying up the dirigibles, violent winds could turn the Blimp around, possibly puncturing it.

The mast, added to the top of the building, allows dirigibles to anchor For awhile to refuel and to have service done. This design took a while to develop + soon became bad. Saftey was a factor. Most dirigibles, from outside of the @LOCATION2. were run on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accedents. For example on May 6, 1937 German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like that would happen in a heavily populated area like @CAPS1 then there would be a problem. These were a couple of the many obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																						199	15	226	9	0	0	4.728643216080402	13.266666666666667	68	26	12	11	4	27	97	8.0	8.81	8.32	29	6.4	8.06	6.571428571428571	9.2	277
9797	15747	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first big obstacle was designing the mast. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building; it had a flat roof. If a dirigible was moored it would add additional stress to the frame, and wind pressure would be a factor as well. The mooring mast was never destined to fulfill the purpose of landing dirigibles, because it isn't safe, nature (dirigible with swivel in back) it could possibly be weighed down by lead in back but that cant be hung above pedestrians on the street. A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against air ships flying to low. Although, this had happened two dirigibles had attempted to moor there the first turned back due to bad weather conditions and the second one was as a publicity stunt had dropped off newspapers before the landing gear could be installed so they had to use a wire to recieve them. In result the idea was shelved.	3	3		3																						186	8	204	4	0	0	4.634408602150538	23.25	48	26	11	12	3	16	107	12.0	9.35	8.53	32	10.0	12.76	12.2	11.9	263

Al Smith decided that was a good idea to let dirigibles anchor on top of his building for some hours for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" But the dirigibles were docked by an electric winch that tied the ship to the mast. The dirigibles would swing and people would still get on and off safely. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building worked/talked with experts and got equipment ""and mooring operations oat the U.S. Naval Air Station"". which the navy was the leader in the development of dirigibles in the U.S. and knew everything. The Navy offered its dirigibles to be used for testing the mast.

One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers.

To fix this, the frame of the Empire state building would need to be strengthened.  Another problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below.  Dirigibles using hydrogen could burst into flames.  Also high winds would make it hard for the dirigible to tether to the mooring mast.  The dirigible could not be weighed down since the weights would dangle over pedestrians on the streets.

This was not an easy task; in fact it was never achieved. Some reasons for this are the very building itself. The mooring mast was to be on top of the building, and its height and weight and wind pressure on the building was dangerous. In paragraph nine it is stated that: ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" But even more than just the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York created a few major obstacles. First, most international blimps used Hydrogen rather than helium-which is highly Flammable. A fire or explosion in the location that the mooring mast was to be located would be devastating to the city. Secondly, there were shifting winds ""due to violent air currents"" atop the building. They caused the backend of the dirigible to swerve. Weights could not be used on the blimp, though, because of the people below and the height at which everything took place. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So essentially, the objective of this project could not be reached ed unless legislation was changed.

He said a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on.

Safty was a big issue because the blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with Hydrogen, which is highly flamable. It would be a huge disaster if one of them exploaded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were always changing and there was no way to keep the dirigibles from moving in the wind and it could be dangerous. There was, also, a law about how low you can fly over urban areas and in order to land correctly, you would be breaking that law, and flying that low would risk wind pusing the dirigible into the top of the building and puncturing it.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in trying to have dirigibles dock at the building. For example, one obstacle that is faced is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is an extremely flammable gas, and if a dirigible is destroyed by fire like the Hindenburg it could cause a terrible accident in a heavily populated area like New York. Therefore the builders face an obstacle of a safety issue with the dirigibles if one catches on fire in New York. Another important obstacle is that strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building causes the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, which causes the dirigibles to not get close enough to the mooring mass. Also the wind creates a risk that a dirigible could be blown onto a sharp spire of another building, ""and the dirigible could be punctured which causes a dangerous situation for the captain. To weigh down the dirigible so that it does not swivel as much in the wind, the controllers would have to use lead weights. Though the lead weights lessen the swiveling it is not practical or safe because lead weights would be hanging above pedestrians on the street, and if a lead weight fell it could be fatal. Lastly, if the dirigible to moor at the Empire State Building it would be breaking an existing law.

One problem was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. It would add unwanted stress to the building frame. Another issue was the gas used to fill the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being very flamable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densley populated area, downtown New York. Towards the top of the building, violent air currents caused another problem. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast. A final delema was an existing law that prohibited airships flying to low over urban areas, such as New York. Due to these obsticles, the ability to dock a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building was destined to @CAPS1.	4	3		4																						159	9	177	8	0	0	4.735849056603773	17.666666666666668	53	20	11	6	1	19	82	9.7	9.22	8.49	32	9.0	10.1	8.0	11.2	233

The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long Dirigible would a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and @MONEY1 of modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that forbid airships to fly too low over urban areas. the factor of nature made the mooring mast Idea completely @CAPS1. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to Violent air currents, even the capitain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible.

10211	16161	6	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to acommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly. Another obstacle the builders face was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.	4	4		4																						246	15	265	2	0	0	4.849593495934959	16.4	67	27	20	10	3	15	143	9.6	10.15	7.6	39	8.5	9.97	10.666666666666666	12.1	374
10216	16166	6	"In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many problems. One of the more obvious issues was that of the make-up of the dirigibles themselves. At the time, they consisted of hydrogen, which, although allowed for a lower density, was highly flammable. This concept was proven and brought to light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a famous dirigible. If a dirigible were to catch fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the civilians below. Another topic of debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such winds could easily cause a lack of stability for a dirigible which could in turn place added stress on the building itself. Another problem caused by winds is the fact that the dirigible might crash into other buildings, causing, the fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and the dirigible to crash. In the end, it was a project deemed too risky to continue."	3	3		3																						187	9	211	12	0	0	4.7967914438502675	20.77777777777778	56	20	11	6	3	22	101	11.6	9.81	8.97	36	10.2	11.31	10.333333333333334	12.3	278

These were the obstacles the builders faced in an attempt to create a mast and allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																						116	5	123	2	0	0	4.603448275862069	23.2	41	17	3	0	4	5	60	11.8	9.35	7.37	16	11.2	11.0	12.2	12.3	172

When they did that they never bothered to put proper landing gear down for the dirigibles. It was a bad day out, weatherwise, then it would be very difficult to land a dirigible without the proper landing gear. The dirigible is over @NUM1 feet long, without a very large landing service, it would be dangerous for the people in the dirigible, the people on the ground, and the people helping land the dirigible.	1	2		2																						100	5	112	6	0	0	4.62	20.0	24	10	10	6	1	12	63	10.3	8.76	6.37	10	9.9	10.0	12.0	11.2	146
10288	16238	6	the Empire State building faced many problems.To dock a dirigible, It needed a good/safe dock site. Also, the wind so high up would make it nearly impossible for a dirigible to stay docked. Finally, the dirigible would be very hazardous to the people below because It was extremely Flammable.	2	2		2																						49	4	59	3	0	0	4.88	12.5	10	5	8	8	0	8	26	10.2	10.38	7.67	6	9.6	8.15	10.5	11.9	77
10297	16247	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The major obstacle to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. To allow dirigibles to anchor at empire state building for several hours a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire buildings flat roof, so rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. Once architects had designed the mooring mast it could be complete and useful. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building.	2	2		2																						151	7	160	2	0	0	4.880794701986755	21.571428571428573	50	18	13	5	2	8	75	12.3	10.68	7.53	20	10.5	10.76	15.25	12.0	230

This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building"" (lines @NUM1).

If a dirigible was held by a single cable, this would add stress to the building's frame.

""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, line @NUM2) The wind would cause the dirigible to sway and not be very stable.

10314	16264	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some minor obstacles were the frame and strength of the building. Other obstacles were major such as nature which cannot be controlled. In paragraph nine the author explains that if a thousand-foot dirigibles were to be moored to the top of the Empire State Building it would add stress to the building's frame. Also with wind pressure the building's foundation would be affected. In order to allow dirigibles to dock, the frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. As nature as a great affect on the use of the mooring mast it would be almost impossible for dirigibles to be tethered onto the building. The wind would send the dirigibles swiveling around the mooring mast as the author describes in paragraph fourteen.      Other obstacles the builders faced were most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, most landing fields weighed down the back of the blimps would lead weight (which wouldn't be safe to have dangling over pedestrians), the last problem was there was an existing law againts airships flying low over urban areas.

One of these obstacles being stress. Yes, stress. This is because when you have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building, only by which is held by a single cable tether, it adds stress to the frame of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. Seeing as most dirigibles have been known to use hydrogen rather than helium, you would think hydrogen is the one to go with. Unfortunately, hydrogen is a fire caution because it is extremely flamable. So safety was definitely another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. A final obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is simply because the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, on repeat because violent currents would constantly shifting the winds on the top of the building. There would be no solution, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, in the informative excerpt, The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon Lüsted.	3	4		4																						223	12	250	13	0	0	4.901345291479821	18.583333333333332	70	25	8	12	1	21	122	11.8	10.44	7.26	31	10.0	10.63	12.4	12.4	339

If a dirigible was to catch on fire, then the whole Empire State Building would be destroyed, including everyone in it. It also wasn't safe because strong, violent winds could blow and detach the dirigible, causing danger to pedestrians below.

The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't use helium, they use hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire it would cause a threat to New York City which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another problem was winds. Winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" Was attempting to reach the mooring mast. The captain couldn't get anywhere near the mast.

10421	16371	6	Creating a mooring mast to sit atop the Empire State Building that would function and allow dirigibles to dock there was an incredibly challenging task for those who built the Empire State Building. Because the building was not originally designed to support the extra weight and size of a mooring mast, architects had to work to redesign the frame of the whole building. The architects modified plans to strengthen the steel frame of the building enough so that it could handle the added stress of a mooring mast. While builders were able to fix this problem, many obstacles remained that could not be avoided. One of these was the danger of attempting to control a dirigible. Dirigibles were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen which would threaten the safety of the citizens of highly populated New York City. Also, dirigibles were traditionally weighed down with lead while docked to keep the blimb from floating around in the wind. This could not be done on the Empire State Building because it would mean lead bricks would be dangling over pedestrians constantly. Besides all these practical obstacles, it was against the law for aircrafts to fly over urban areas, and that was the final obstacle that kept the mooring mast from being used.	3	4		4																						211	9	225	5	0	0	4.957345971563981	23.444444444444443	54	33	11	10	3	14	113	13.7	11.38	8.54	38	11.2	12.96	14.75	12.3	308

If a plan is not completely safe, it shouldn't happen. The Empire State Building would not have been stable enough with the winds being so powerful. Also, most dirigibles or blimps used hydrogen not helium which would be extremely dangerous if the blimp caught on fire. Especially in a place as crowded as New York.

10453	16403	6	In building the Empire State Building, builders had to deal with numerous obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was what the dirigibles would attach to. Builders thought that by adding a mooring mast it would make docking easy, although they disregarded the building's foundation. The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly. The dirigibles clearly went against this law and the idea for using the mast for docking. After failed attempts at docking the idea went away, and builders realized the plan would never work.	2	3		3																						151	9	169	6	0	0	5.2781456953642385	16.77777777777778	39	29	7	9	4	16	79	11.8	12.41	7.92	27	8.7	10.43	10.833333333333334	12.1	229

10534	16484	6	There was three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the densely populated area, the violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. First, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Since the dock would be above downtown New York, there is a higher risk of the dock blowing up due to the density. Secondly, nature was a great obstacle. There were many winds on top of the building and the wind currents were constantly changing violently, there was a gigantic fear of the dirigible swiveling around and hitting another building. Finally, the dock could never allow a ship to be tied up legally due to the existing law of airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigible would not be safe, and the entire idea will drop. For these reasons or obstacles, many builders of the Empire state building faced while attempting to allow blimps to dock there.	3	3		3																						173	8	192	11	0	0	4.895953757225434	21.625	48	23	14	15	6	19	89	12.5	10.5	8.54	32	10.5	12.11	13.0	12.8	256

The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air.

10590	16540	6	Architects constructing the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The idea of making a mast wasnt so farfetched at first. As construction neared completion many concerns arose. Many dirigibles outside the United States use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. Another problem was the docking of the blimps, winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast. Lastly a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes. When all the problems came together the idea of mooring dirigibles quietly disappeared.	3	2		3																						116	8	126	1	0	0	5.362068965517241	14.5	39	17	6	7	0	9	51	11.1	12.75	9.66	30	8.9	10.63	8.142857142857142	11.9	184
10593	16543	6	When the Empire State building was built they came accross some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. Some reasons are when the dirigibles were made they werent made to go high. So when the Empire State building went up the dirigible had a slight problem. Most dirigibles that are made out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. But, hydrogen is highly flameable.	1	1		1																						66	5	73	1	0	0	4.924242424242424	13.2	18	11	4	4	1	6	38	8.3	9.85	7.4	12	7.3	7.7	7.0	9.9	97
10594	16544	6	When builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple obstacles. The most important was the issue of safety because the dirigible would cause chaos if it caught on fire. Hydrogen would be too dangerous to use in the dirigible if it could catch fire at any moment.Another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent air currents, and these would shift the position of the dirigible if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast.The last issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height, for it was too close to an urban area. This made it illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were allowed to try before the idea was ruined. Neither could successfully dock, and the idea was finished.	4	3		3																						188	11	209	7	0	0	4.557894736842106	17.272727272727273	46	25	11	6	4	17	113	10.7	8.88	7.53	27	9.1	11.34	13.0	11.6	267
10595	16545	6	"Based on the excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there seems to be two main problems with the docking of dirigibles in New York City.

The Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, but the operator pulled away for fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. The second problem, though slightly easier to rectify was the law that prohibited any aircraft near the buildings of New York City. This basically made even attempting to dock in illegal. There are many reasons why the idea of zeppelins didn't get off the ground worldwide, and this excerpt about New York was a prime example of the obsticles that couldn't be safely tackled."	3	3		3																						145	7	164	7	0	0	4.8068965517241375	20.714285714285715	47	15	8	9	3	17	78	11.6	9.75	9.35	32	9.0	12.69	12.4	12.0	210
10597	16547	6	"Based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames. The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the Fire @CAPS1 the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. With those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely. After realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built."	3	3		3																						165	9	186	8	0	0	5.042424242424242	18.333333333333332	45	18	14	12	2	20	83	11.5	11.2	9.14	36	9.2	11.93	12.2	12.5	254
10601	16551	6	The dream for the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock On the top of it. It sounded like a great idea but the builders faced many obstacles trying to reach the goal of having them dock there. The first problem they faced was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation so it wouldn't stress the building's frame. To do this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with a illuminated inside. The building was now 102 floors. Even though all the hard work the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles wer highly flamable, after one caught on fire in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building didn't want the same to happy in the highly populated New York City. Also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off. Also there was a law that stated the air craft's can't fly to low to urban areas. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible was never achieved.	4	4		4																						224	12	243	1	0	0	4.59375	18.666666666666668	59	30	15	11	4	14	134	9.5	8.88	7.52	29	8.2	9.62	8.5	10.1	312
10614	16564	6	Although constructing a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, a number of obstacles prevented this theory from becoming reality. The builders and architects had to change the frame of the building completely to accommodate the weight of the mast, and this costed over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen over helium, which was very flammable, and if a dirigible suffered the same fate as the Hindenburg, it would cause a much greater accident at ground level. The greatest challenge that the mast faced was constanly shifting winds from violent air currents. This caused the back of the ship swivel around the mast, even when tied to it, which caused a problem. Most importantly there was already an existing law that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up to it. Although the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, this feat couldn't be accomplished due to the obstacles.	4	4		4																						190	7	208	10	0	0	4.9	27.142857142857142	52	25	12	10	3	17	105	15.2	10.86	8.89	36	12.7	15.05	16.75	14.3	282

10625	16575	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had planned for it to be the tallest building in existance, but they were thwarted by the engineer of the Chrysler Building. They put a new top onto the building, making it forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men, Al Smith decided to add a crown of his own to the building. He built a mooring at the 102nd floor that would accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building. The also needed to finds safe ways to dock the blimps. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch. Balloons were powered by flammable gases too, a safety hazard in a big city. Plus, weights could not be hanging over city streets in order to way down the ship. These problems made the dirigible popularity drop quite alot, so the mooring was never used to its full potential.	3	2		3																						189	12	209	6	0	0	4.603174603174603	15.75	52	27	16	3	4	17	103	8.1	8.52	8.35	28	7.1	8.86	8.666666666666666	9.3	259
10631	16581	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles and they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the overall safety. Dirigibles that were built outside the U. S required the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas that poses great danger. An example of this was when the Hindenburg was destroyed on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. It finally occurred, that if a dirigible was destroyed over a densely populated area, it could potentially hurt a lot more people. A second obstacle that builders had to face was nature itself. At that altitude, there were violent air currents causing winds to constantly shift. This was a danger to the landing of dirigibles too. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would keep swaying. It would be harder to dock passengers, and allow for inspections. Also, dirigibles would typically weighted down with lead weights. However, because it was so high up, this was not practical or safe. The last obstacle these builders had to face were laws. One specific law did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. It was also illegal for the airship to tie up or even aproach the building. Overall, these obstacles denied the potential of the mooring mast.	3	4		4																						219	17	247	11	0	0	4.840182648401827	12.882352941176471	56	30	18	16	4	30	114	7.5	9.15	8.42	45	6.9	8.9	7.125	10.6	332

Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas.
