Saeng and her mother has been thourgh a lot and when she failed the @CAPS1 test, she was more depressed than before, The author concludes this story with this paragraph to give readers the thought oF how it is to be determined to adapt and survive in a different place and though Saeng and her mother are away from their homeland they still enjoy the things they did in Vietnam, like the flowers, and the hot peppers and bitter melons, her friends disagree with the taste but it doesnt stop her from enjoying what she loves most.	2	2		2																						113	2	121	5	0	0	4.415929203539823	56.5	24	15	8	4	9	10	68	27.6	8.84	9.51	15	21.8	23.31	26.5	0.0	144
5985	9541	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined. For example, saeng failed her driver’s test but upon reaching the hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her old home. Also, while she is planting the plant, she sees the geese with a new familiarity. This combined makes her determined to complete her test because having two reminders of both homes, it comforts her to know that she can adapt easily and treasure her memories as well.	3	2		3																						88	4	97	5	0	0	4.829545454545454	22.0	17	16	5	4	2	10	50	12.3	10.15	9.03	17	9.5	12.44	13.25	11.7	127
5992	9548	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things.	1	1		1																						77	5	85	2	0	0	4.282051282051282	15.6	9	15	2	3	3	9	50	6.6	6.96	6.66	5	6.9	8.24	7.9	9.4	107
5996	9552	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show Saeng’s determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when she’s in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, “It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.”	2	2		2																						108	8	121	6	0	0	4.9907407407407405	13.5	26	16	2	7	1	18	63	8.8	10.14	7.96	19	7.4	9.1	7.0	10.7	159
6001	9557	4	In the last paragraph they trying to express what is coming. When winter is over spring will come which means the hibiscus will come back and it will be like home. Also the geese will return and because of that she will take the quiz again. To her it’s like starting all over and hopefully she will pass. Also she loves the hibiscus and seamce thats back maybe she will do so much beter. Overall a new time is coming.	1	1		1																						80	6	87	0	0	0	4.225	13.333333333333334	12	14	3	11	4	7	51	5.1	5.9	6.86	8	3.8	6.32	6.166666666666667	7.2	99
6006	9562	4	The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam	3	3		3																						136	7	145	3	0	0	4.522058823529412	19.428571428571427	32	24	11	6	6	11	75	9.6	8.47	7.5	19	8.5	10.41	8.833333333333334	11.2	188
6007	9563	4	The author concludes the sentence on the end to state when the plants start over growing and the geese come back, she will try again. For example, the plants have to grow their pedals back and the geese have to make their home and find food again. The author is saying she will take the test again when the geese come back and the plants grow again.	1	1		1																						67	3	72	2	0	0	4.223880597014926	22.333333333333332	16	14	0	7	4	3	41	9.6	7.09	6.16	5	6.1	9.52	11.5	6.4	76
6010	9566	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																						64	1	66	1	0	0	4.34375	64.0	19	8	0	4	2	5	34	31.0	8.61	9.28	6	24.7	26.85	34.0	0.0	82

6015	9571	4	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem, it’s adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example,  in lines @NUM1 Saeng’s thought’s are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saeng‘s eyes now and swept over her “and” in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept.” This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because it’s gone. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said  “and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” It means that she will overcome all that and move on."	3	3		3																						173	6	187	7	0	0	4.365714285714286	29.166666666666668	42	25	10	9	8	24	97	20.9	8.66	8.8	21	16.6	18.94	17.666666666666668	11.2	220
6017	9573	4	The author concludes the story with this because she is say that she is going to grow with the season chang. She is in a new country and just failed her drivers test. She feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home. In the story @CAPS1 mother says “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake its strong enough to make it through the winter. I think that Saeng can relate to that because if the flower can make it in the winter tha she can make it in a new country.	2	2		2																						95	5	100	0	0	0	4.063157894736842	19.0	19	15	3	4	2	8	60	7.2	5.92	6.91	7	6.0	8.02	8.7	5.7	117

6031	9587	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, “I failed the test,” (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence.	1	2		2																						91	4	99	3	0	0	4.450549450549451	22.75	22	21	2	5	3	10	46	10.9	8.25	7.72	9	8.6	10.44	12.375	8.8	115
6036	9592	4	The author concludes the story with “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because Saeng fails the test by spending her money on a big mac and not having enough for the type of flower her mother sent for. So since Saeng failed the test, she wants to take the test again and make her mother happy.	0	0		0																						73	2	77	2	0	0	4.1506849315068495	36.5	21	11	4	3	4	7	41	16.4	7.09	7.83	4	12.8	15.15	18.75	0.0	88
6040	9596	4	After reading “Winter Hibiscus, I can tell that Saeng is a determined person, and likes nature. I can also tell that she is determined to pass the test. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the beginning of the story, Saeng fails her driving test. She walks home, and as she is walking, she comes across a familiar plant. This takes her to her childhood world. Have her not failed the test, she would have never walked home and come across the plant. The author didn’t want us to forget the reason she walked home. It would have never happened.	1	1		1																						103	8	117	6	0	0	4.533980582524272	12.875	21	19	4	5	3	15	57	6.3	7.35	7.19	9	4.8	6.33	6.857142857142857	7.6	135
6045	9601	4	Saeng was happy when the snow was disappearing because she couldn’t wait for spring to come back to see the animals running around by her garden and seeing the beautiful geese flying in after they long & hard hibernation. So Saeng was excited to see everything grown back so she is guaranteed to pass the test this time	0	0		0																						58	3	59	0	0	0	4.517241379310345	19.333333333333332	10	12	5	4	2	3	32	14.5	9.46	7.54	5	12.0	14.21	18.0	0.0	82

The girl was in a new place and back at home where she is from there are alot of beautiful flowers that she loved to look at and being in a new place that doesn't have these flowers really gets her down and has her upset. She misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers. For example, the girl says, “It’s-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", here she stops because she is so upset that she can’t say home. The flower she has right now isn't real but when the real one blossom in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her confidence to retake the test."	2	2		2																						151	7	170	5	0	0	4.151315789473684	21.714285714285715	27	23	11	10	6	13	99	13.4	6.74	7.02	10	11.5	12.87	13.5	8.8	191

For example, taking the test means that she will change. Also what it means is that she ready to take on new thing. For instance, the test to her is getting ready to take on a new thing.

6049	9605	4	The author ends with this paragraph to show gthat Saeng had. Hope. It shows that there is still hope. The ending paragraph makes you  kind of create your own ending for Saeng. I like to imagine Saeng with a big garden next to her and and she passes the test.	1	1		1																						50	5	56	0	0	0	4.098039215686274	10.2	11	12	2	4	2	7	28	4.4	5.38	7.1	5	3.4	5.0	5.25	3.1	61
6050	9606	4	"I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. This final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea. It tells us that in the spring when everything is coming to life Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in thelast paragraph show how Saeng and her mother have adapted and that new things are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text it says, “I know"", her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. It’s flower aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This means and represents that even though life is different here away from Saeng home they will adapt and survive in their own way."	2	2		2																						143	8	156	5	0	0	4.7272727272727275	17.875	36	22	10	13	6	18	75	12.8	9.87	8.24	16	9.0	11.2	11.4	10.5	188
6071	9627	4	I think the author includes this because she doesn’t want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then “I will take the test again.” This quote is saying she @MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you don’t no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng @MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.	2	2		2																						214	9	221	0	0	0	4.065420560747664	23.77777777777778	35	41	7	9	10	13	136	13.0	6.63	7.07	13	10.5	12.99	18.0	8.8	260
6072	9628	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 @NUM1. When the author write all those things in nature that will happen it symbolized re-birth and a fresh start, a new chance and that is what Saeng needs with her drivers license. The author put powerfully. Put those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a sense of roundness and end with that last paragraph, the story is complete.	2	1		2																						124	8	138	5	0	0	4.491935483870968	15.5	33	15	11	10	5	19	73	8.6	7.71	7.32	14	6.7	8.69	8.333333333333334	8.8	161
6074	9630	4	I believe the author of “winter Hibiscus “ends the story like she did because saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test.  Saeng states in the story “it’s the flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, thes winte hibiscus. That’s what matters.” I think saeng is using this as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam. She plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol. She will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring.	2	1		2																						123	7	134	3	0	0	4.233870967741935	17.714285714285715	29	22	5	7	3	20	69	8.9	6.91	7.73	10	6.6	8.53	10.8	7.8	149
6084	9640	4	I think That The author concludes the story with This paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there. By saying shell do the test again shows that she doesnt want to let ths defeat her in her new home and her new life.	2	1		2																						74	3	79	1	0	0	4.081081081081081	24.666666666666668	13	15	4	3	2	5	45	10.1	6.39	7.21	7	8.2	10.96	13.0	7.8	86
6085	9641	4	The author concludes saeng vow in the story to show that saeng can and does have the ability to overcome obstacle. Saeng  feels like she is a failer. Her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her driving test that she failed. The geese represent survial and to never give up, to keep trying your hardest to success.	2	1		2																						60	4	66	1	0	0	4.590163934426229	15.25	14	13	3	1	2	8	33	8.0	8.63	9.12	12	6.8	9.33	8.0	10.1	84
6091	9647	4	Saeng's peRsonality in this stoRy shows deteRmination and confident. I think she feels that she could do moRe experienced things on different plants. I also think this is a peRfect hobby experience foR someone who loves Plants. I feel that Saeng @MONTH1 have accomplished heR goals of planting. I think she @MONTH1 want to puRsue heR career in gaRdenning. When she stated that when the plants come back aRound, she would take the test again. I think she means that, she is willing to exploRe more plants. I think she @MONTH1 have got this experience of planting fRom heR motheR. To me this @MONTH1 have been a family tradition. Saeng will pRobably have kids and teach them about different types of floweRs.	1	1		1																						122	10	134	2	0	0	4.795081967213115	12.2	29	21	8	6	2	13	68	7.3	8.86	7.87	18	5.7	7.83	6.375	9.6	173
6092	9648	4	The author ended the story with the paragraph in order to show that Saeng is looking forward into her life and with a positive outlook. It shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore. The hibiscus is used as a device for this story’s plot. When changes happen with the hibiscus, changes happen in the story. At first, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she plans it, things start to look up. She begins to accept the change when the last paragraph says, “when they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” it shows that Saeng is looking at her future positively, and with this positive change, the hibiscus is now beginning to bloom. The author concludes the story in a symbolic way that helps express the story’s themes.	3	2		3																						158	9	176	8	0	0	4.474683544303797	17.555555555555557	33	29	8	7	5	21	89	8.4	7.65	7.41	17	6.6	8.31	5.875	9.4	211
6093	9649	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph “Saeng vowed silently to herself” because she Saeng wants to do in proper time and season. “winter season”, the land or soil was so cold that plants was not able to grow properly. ”Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars”, and she Saeng failed the test. ”There was frail, wiry beauty to her Saeng mother that touched Saeng deeply”, she Saeng mother is shining when she worked to plants. These all are the description that concludes in the past which want to make correction and shine like her mother and also to pass the test.	1	1		1																						100	5	109	4	0	0	4.7	20.0	29	15	6	5	5	14	47	25.7	10.35	9.12	8	19.3	21.6	26.5	0.0	127
6095	9651	4	The author is trying to convey a sense of hope for Saeng in her new country. After noting that she failed her test, which is probably a citizenship test, the author wants to conclude the story with something that reasures the reader. It is obvious that this test was important because Saeng could not even look her mother in the eye. This was probably why she bought the flower for her mother. The ending reasures the reader so that you don’t wonder how it will workout for Saeng.	1	1		1																						88	5	95	2	0	0	4.465909090909091	17.6	21	12	3	3	0	9	50	8.4	7.89	7.02	9	7.8	8.4	8.8	8.8	120

6103	9659	4	In the story “ Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a well mannered carhoined. The author ended with that paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to persuade even though for away from home. She is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story she had failed a test and the hibiscus test her feeling nostalgic.

6111	9667	4	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.	2	2		2																						140	6	148	2	0	0	4.156028368794326	23.5	29	24	4	6	9	10	82	15.7	7.15	7.29	8	12.2	15.14	13.75	9.5	168

When her mothesaid this, it showed that she was displeased. The narrative states, ""I-I failed the test""(Ho). Saeng was not proud to displease her parents in any way. By saying, ""When hey come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return  and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again""(Ho), the author is just showing Saeng's love and want to grow foe her parents; it shows maturity."	2	2		2																						129	8	158	10	0	1	4.561538461538461	16.25	31	22	4	6	5	29	72	8.4	7.71	8.01	17	6.0	8.28	5.875	8.5	169
6132	9689	4	She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring.	1	2		2																						87	2	90	1	0	0	4.022988505747127	43.5	14	16	7	5	4	5	51	19.2	6.92	8.52	8	15.3	17.67	22.25	0.0	103

6141	9698	4	In the story the author concludes with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself’ in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she did that to say that you shouldn’t give up. In the story Saeng goes to the store and “touched a petal.” She buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home. In this way it seems Saeng is willing to give up her memories of her past. When she brings home the plant and her mom and her plant it in the garden. I think Saeng is trying to make her new home like her old.	2	2		2																						123	7	131	3	0	0	3.9430894308943087	17.571428571428573	26	21	5	5	5	15	73	9.4	5.4	7.3	8	7.0	10.49	13.0	6.7	141

6152	9709	4	I think that the author uses this quote, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.” @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. “But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?” “BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.” @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable.	3	3		3																						182	14	203	9	0	3	4.284153005464481	13.071428571428571	41	30	12	9	7	29	100	8.9	6.79	6.81	17	6.4	9.18	18.333333333333332	8.5	223
6158	9715	4	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, with the strong paragraph of one sentence starting that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This sentence leaves the reader in suspense while incorporating the main point of the story and combining them to express an idea about what might happen in a continuation on the future of @CAPS1 and this story. After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort her mother and her-self. While she stood watching the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng’s feelings to stay determined and take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a string sentence which not only summerized the story, but left a cliff hangs.	3	2		3																						128	5	141	6	0	0	4.8203125	25.6	37	21	5	3	6	15	68	14.1	10.39	7.62	17	10.9	12.43	14.0	10.8	183
6163	9720	4	The author conclude the story with this paragraph because the author wants to remind the reader and summarize the story.

6182	9739	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. “It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng should be strong even I times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, throught the quiet repition of season upon season…” It shows that saeng realized that the new place that she’s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home – In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that saeng should face the new reality of the world.

6196	9753	4	I think Minfong Ho concluded her story “Winter Hibiscus” the way she did to show the avid determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test. Now that she had a moments of her homeland and her family there she was most likely reminded that they would’ve wanted her to succeed, and so she promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This is why I feel that “Winter Hibiscus” was concluded in this way.	2	2		2																						100	4	106	2	0	0	4.45	25.0	21	19	4	6	4	10	59	12.0	8.48	8.19	14	10.7	12.0	15.0	12.2	136

6203	9760	4	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again,” shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with ”when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”	1	2		2																						213	10	229	9	0	0	4.769953051643192	21.3	50	37	13	13	13	22	116	12.9	10.16	6.89	15	9.0	10.42	11.6	9.4	280

6226	9783	4	The author concludes the story with this last paragraph because it shows by spring she will be ready to retake her test. It shows that like the geese who care and come back, she will have time to study and pass her test. In the story the author includes this last paragraph to truly show her dedication to eventually grow to be comfortable in her new home and to pass her drivers test all in good time. Saeng wants to be comfortable with her new life but isn’t yet because of what one misses. But she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter.

In the story she said “Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet reptition of season upon season, almost familiar to hernow” This means that when she had just moved here she thought that everything was strange because, she have not seen anything like this before. Now as she is living here to would get use to it because, she knows what will happen nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now	1	2		2																						120	6	128	4	0	0	4.45	20.0	13	18	7	12	0	10	82	11.5	8.42	6.01	6	9.1	10.93	11.2	9.4	155
6256	9813	4	The reader thinks the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl is saying she will try again, and take that test. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng, the girl tock a test and failed it. And she got this flower that brong back memories from the past and decied She tock take this test now that thing are going to get better again. Also when the girl saw those geese flying over her, she knew they will be coming back, coming back after winter in the spring, and when they do her flower will blossom, the one that brings back good memories from the past and she will retake that test and past. Those are some examples of why I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	2	2		2																						132	5	143	7	0	0	4.363636363636363	26.4	30	23	4	7	7	15	79	12.3	7.78	6.86	10	10.0	11.77	13.0	8.8	167
6266	9823	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she’ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she’ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn’t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.	1	1		1																						73	4	77	0	0	0	4.438356164383562	18.25	12	14	4	5	3	6	44	8.6	8.12	7.14	5	6.9	8.96	10.125	8.8	93
6270	9827	4	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is about a young girl who cares for gardening over schoolwork. The given conclusion is explaining, when spring comes, and the winter hibiscus is gone, she will pass the school test she failed before. Saeng only cares for the winter Hibiscus right now, for example, the line “I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” Explains she used all her money on this plant rather than any other food. Also the quote “I failed the test” with Saeng crying shows she failed it only because she was worrying about the hibiscus. In conclusion over the spring, when the winter hibiscus is gone, Saeng will focus on school more rather than gardening. Maybe now she will pass her test and go back to her hobby of gardening.	1	1		1																						129	6	142	7	0	0	4.658914728682171	21.5	37	20	3	12	2	17	69	11.3	9.11	6.91	12	9.3	10.46	12.0	11.5	175
6273	9830	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph to set the sonip theme. In the story, the @CAPS1 represents very important thing to saeng – confidence, beauty, adaptation… some things she can apply to herself, & her memories of her old homeland. She had failed the driving test. Afterwards, she bought the @CAPS1 to comfort her homesickness. I saw the @CAPS1 as a sort of metaphor to Saeng the same @CAPS1, but growing differently in a different area just as she is still the same but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the @CAPS1 budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland by the @CAPS1 blossoming ,it can represent her love for the homeland. When the author wrote “then I will take that test again” it is referring to the new confidence she @MONTH1 have later when the @CAPS1 blooms (another @CAPS1 /person metaphor)	3	3		3																						150	8	167	7	0	0	4.695364238410596	18.875	44	17	10	7	3	24	80	10.3	9.23	7.63	21	8.2	10.39	10.166666666666666	11.5	214
6275	9832	4	The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	2	2		2																						133	4	146	9	0	0	4.443609022556391	33.25	28	18	6	6	6	16	85	16.1	8.48	8.02	17	12.7	15.12	18.666666666666668	11.2	172

In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng says, “And that rich, sweet scent – that was familiar too,"" talks about how nice the flowers were and how familiar they were because she reconized the scent. Saeng was already upset about leaving her home in @LOCATION1, then coming to @LOCATION2 and then failing her drivers test, just made it worse, but then she saw the flower and it reminded her of her home, so she felt a little better.

In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a “touching” affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story. The first example, is in the beginning of the conclusion, it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself”. In this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story. ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again” This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout, the geese in the end, and the failing of the test in the beginning.

6321	9878	4	The author uses this paragraph to conclude to show she’s going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings. For example the story says “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon, almost fimiliar to her now”. Saying that she is getting used to where she is now and wants and is willing to give it a chance.

6323	9880	4	The Author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant “dies” in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle.	2	2		2																						103	3	111	5	0	0	4.796116504854369	34.333333333333336	28	16	3	4	7	14	57	18.3	10.63	9.17	18	14.3	17.6	20.333333333333332	14.6	149
6325	9882	4	He ends the story this way to show that she wants to and is willing to overcome leaving her homeland. In the story she goes to a green house. She is in the green house to test herself. She finds a plant from her homeland and and it reminds her of her grandmother. She finds other plants and they remind her of her homeland and she cries. I think she had a real connection with her grandmother.

6335	9892	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave readers guessing and wondering what will be next. You can tell by the tone of the last paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author seems to leave at tone of suspense.	1	1		1																						69	3	76	5	0	0	4.521739130434782	23.0	15	12	3	3	3	10	40	17.1	8.89	8.32	9	12.0	14.96	18.25	0.0	86

6339	9896	4	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers.

6352	9909	4	It shows not to give up, it ends almost  the same way it began, it shows that people should not stay too attached to the past each are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then she will try again later to pass it. Also the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to which is a good way of writing. One last thing is that it shows that people shouldn’t become too attached to the past because if they look at one thing that reminds them of it they @MONTH1 fall apart, that is why she takes the test, to see if she can look at the familiar flowers without falling apart.	2	2		2																						141	4	150	4	0	0	4.077464788732394	35.5	21	29	6	10	1	11	89	15.5	6.74	7.29	11	12.3	14.4	12.5	6.0	173

The author’s reasoning for saying this is because the presence of memories from Saeng’s homeland comforts her. So much that they she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous. “it was like walking into another world,” said Saeng, when she entered the florist shop, after failing her drivers test. It was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was only thinking about the plants, flowers. The flowers take her to a happy peace and make her feel at home. Like everything is going to be alright. This is  why the author concludes with such a sentence because us as readers should show memories of her farmland will help her pass her drivers test.	2	3		3																						163	8	179	9	0	0	4.615853658536586	20.5	35	24	7	9	4	23	96	12.1	9.29	7.5	21	8.8	10.3	13.75	9.2	220

6360	9917	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination. Saeng has been through a lot and misses what its like at home. She feels different and out of place but she is still strong. Life goes on, and this paragraph shows that Saeng with move with it. The paragraph says, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring will come, as nothing can stop time. The snow will melt because the weather changes. The geese will fly home and the hibiscus will bloom in spring. Saeng takes a positive look at things and decides to join them. Sure she failed once but she is strong and willing to try again. If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Saeng will always have her memories of home but she is willing to change to her new sorroundings.

6376	9933	4	The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young childs favoriteplant is the hibiscus. I think that the mother and her childs favorite thing to do together would be gardening. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the read kind of a look of question on their faces. It leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. But in my opinion I think it adds some curiosity to the story.	1	1		1																						95	7	102	0	0	0	4.315789473684211	13.571428571428571	21	11	6	5	3	6	56	5.7	6.72	6.8	9	5.1	7.55	6.785714285714286	8.8	127

I depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in Vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. That is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase. But I think as much I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and finally I believed Saeng said this because time brings change.	2	1		2																						108	6	114	0	0	0	4.37037037037037	18.0	20	21	2	10	4	8	62	8.2	7.42	7.6	16	6.8	9.79	9.0	10.5	143
6390	9947	4	The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home.

6391	9948	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to let us know when she’l take it again. When the season change is when she will take it again. Saeng is probably embrassed that why she wants to wait so long. Saeng took a long walk home and stoped at the flower shop. She tried getting her mind off failing the test.

In the story, the author is showing home sickness. The author see a plant that is know where she come from and buy for over @NUM1 her mother couldn’t believe it. She didn’t want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again. The last sentence is showing that author is trying to adapt.	1	1		1																						90	5	96	1	0	0	4.366666666666666	18.0	17	19	4	5	3	9	51	8.2	7.31	6.99	8	6.8	8.53	8.6	7.6	119
6433	9990	4	The conclude the story this way because he can now expand on this story creating a sequel about Saeng’s success. Also be ending the story this way the author is showing now a limit Saeng is and now she will stop at nothing until her test is complete. Saeng is having difficulties adapting to her new lifestyle because the plants and the previous luteries that she had are no longer present. In the story Saeng’s determination is shown when her mother finds out that she spent @NUM1 dollers to have a simular plant. The mother responds by saying their whole garden is worth less than @NUM1 dollers.	1	1		1																						107	5	112	0	0	0	4.588785046728972	21.4	27	14	10	6	2	11	59	10.9	8.94	8.39	17	9.3	10.8	11.2	9.4	148
6446	10003	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home land she will eventualy pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misss the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.	2	2		2																						136	9	145	0	0	0	4.0588235294117645	15.11111111111111	26	21	9	8	4	11	81	5.2	5.27	6.13	12	4.5	7.22	7.833333333333334	6.9	167
6455	10012	4	The author ends the story by saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story. When she gets home her mother “noticed the tear staie on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.” Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story but by the end she felt happy and optimistic.	2	1		2																						95	3	101	4	0	0	4.273684210526316	31.666666666666668	21	14	6	4	6	13	51	22.4	7.91	9.15	8	17.1	19.84	25.25	0.0	117
6467	10024	4	The author ends it with that because it shows that she won’t give up and that she will give her new country a chance. She ends it with that to say that she will be strong like the flower and that she will stay no matter what! That she will be there, in that spot to see it grow back. That's why I think she concluded with that.	1	1		1																						68	4	74	1	1	0	3.823529411764706	17.0	5	11	2	4	2	6	52	5.1	4.12	5.41	1	4.0	7.39	7.75	6.0	75

6479	10036	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time.

6483	10040	4	"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"". The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese & the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one."	2	3		3																						159	8	188	10	0	0	4.389937106918239	19.875	37	23	12	10	10	25	89	12.6	7.55	7.94	15	10.0	12.04	13.75	10.1	205
6485	10042	4	I think the author concludes this paragraph in this story to describe how grown up Saeng is now since it doesn’t look like she leaves with her mom anymore. To the author probably wants to emphasize the reader @CAPS1 of Saeng, now on for she probably leave since she doesn't leave with her mom anymore.

6490	10047	4	In the story the “winter Hibiscus” by minfong Ho the writers ends with a paragraph that concludes the story. One of the reasons she concluded with the last paragraph the @CAPS1 she did is because it tells the reader that Saeng  @CAPS1 not given up on her drivers test. “… Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This explains in more details when  she will take the test Again another years on is because it leaves the reader to think how the rest of the story will go.	1	2		2																						109	4	118	3	0	0	4.241071428571429	28.0	27	15	5	3	2	15	66	26.2	8.26	9.24	13	21.0	22.53	27.0	0.0	143
6493	10050	4	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says “when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.” The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on.	2	2		2																						120	6	129	4	0	0	4.308333333333334	20.0	31	17	5	3	4	12	70	10.9	7.49	8.51	19	10.3	12.6	11.8	11.2	162
6496	10053	4	I think the author ends the story like this becuose of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a simple of her home but also as a symble of good luck. In the text she holds the plant in a very high value, having payed @NUM1 coins for it, So I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing.	1	1		1																						81	3	87	2	0	0	3.876543209876543	27.0	19	11	3	4	1	10	47	10.3	5.0	7.9	7	9.1	12.28	14.5	8.8	98
6497	10054	4	The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to @LOCATION1, the geese show her that she is, even now adapting to her new homeland when she geese seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was pretty but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she came to @LOCATION1, is adopted to the mre resilient and withstand the snow which symbolizes her problems adapting to @LOCATION1. For saeng, the hibiscus budding again represents her becoming stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to go take the test again when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to connect the Hibiscus budding with Saeng overcoming her obstacles.	3	3		3																						130	6	142	6	0	0	5.084615384615384	21.666666666666668	32	24	9	4	4	13	70	13.3	11.43	7.99	23	10.6	11.76	16.25	13.3	192
6498	10055	4	The author chose to conclude the story like that because sheâ€™s saying that it isnâ€™t over and sheâ€™s going to take the test again. In the story Saeng says â€œI- I failed the testâ€� so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.	1	1		1																						49	3	52	0	0	0	4.428571428571429	16.333333333333332	9	12	2	4	2	7	27	11.7	8.36	9.69	4	8.1	10.62	12.75	0.0	60
6501	10058	4	In the story “winter hibiscus” by minfong Ho, the author is concluding the story with this last sentence because its showing everyone that the seasons over for the growing of the plants but when it comes time for the flowers to start growing again she will be back to take care of the plants because its her favorite & they are what she lives for now that she has to take care of them. Also the author probably put the conclusion of the story like that to get people interested in reading more of the story later on because your getting left in a sense of suspense, because you don’t know if she really will go back to the plants or just about them. another reason I think, the auther ended it that is because its still snowing she cares about the plans but she isn’t gonna worry about them until it is the right time again. For example she says “when they come back then I will take the test again,“ that’s showing she isn’t giving up on anythin she loves and she will keep trying until she gets it.	1	1		1																						191	5	199	4	0	0	4.2408376963350785	38.2	32	33	5	16	5	15	124	30.3	8.08	9.19	17	24.4	26.37	28.0	13.0	249
6512	10069	4	I think that she was that way to say, hey I didn’t over come something and I’ll be back next year to take the test again like the hibiscus budding when she snow melts and the geese return @CAPS1 year.	1	1		1																						40	1	42	1	0	0	4.025	40.0	10	7	2	2	2	5	23	17.6	6.22	8.38	3	14.2	17.0	21.0	0.0	47
6519	10076	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, “when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again.	1	1		1																						66	2	72	5	0	0	4.53030303030303	33.0	16	10	1	4	2	10	40	32.9	9.24	9.3	6	25.5	27.01	35.0	0.0	83
6523	10080	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home.  For example, she said “I failed,” talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live. For example, she said “its not like the one at home.” That’s why the author concludes this paragraph.	1	1		1																						79	6	88	3	0	0	4.4875	13.333333333333334	17	13	3	4	0	14	44	7.8	8.0	6.62	7	5.9	7.84	6.25	8.2	104
6530	10087	4	The author finished the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason for conclusion is that it is important for Saeng  to feel at home. When the hibiscus buds it wiil remind her of home and this will comfort her, when she feels at peace and at home she will do better on the test.	1	1		1																						82	3	91	6	0	0	4.228915662650603	27.666666666666668	21	10	2	4	4	12	48	19.2	7.74	7.98	6	15.7	17.38	22.5	0.0	103
6531	10088	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one. She shows she isn’t giving up when she brings home the flower to plant. That also shows she will not forget her old home. Also when she says, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” That shows she is giving her new home another shot and isn’t giving up. Another example is when it says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance. She is not giving up on it.	2	2		2																						156	9	171	9	0	0	4.352564102564102	17.333333333333332	23	27	10	12	5	20	93	12.1	7.61	7.05	11	9.9	12.19	13.5	10.5	207
6544	10101	4	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.In the story, glimpses of @CAPS1 home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. “She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.” Here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saeng’s despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, “then I will take that test again.“you can feel her hope. Also, the author want`s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says,”the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security.	3	3		3																						257	11	278	11	0	0	4.5813953488372094	23.454545454545453	65	40	16	11	14	29	144	14.5	9.12	7.76	29	12.1	13.31	29.5	11.2	349

6585	10142	4	She ends it with this sentence because its a sign of new life. Just as the winter that killed the plants ending life, the spring will come and start anew. This is how Saeng feels because she left her country and all the memories left behind she feels out of place like the winter hibiscus but as the spring comes she’ll feel as anew person ready and able to take challenges as she said here “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now” she describes that with a new season comes new changes and upon those changes she will go on to take the drivers test again.	3	2		3																						112	3	117	2	0	0	4.330357142857143	37.333333333333336	25	18	8	7	5	9	61	17.6	8.19	7.6	7	14.3	16.35	18.0	9.7	140

6598	10157	4	In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. She puts in examples from the story that could help find these reasons. One reason is that we know she wont give up. In the story she says “Then I will take the test again.” It tells us that she will keep trying and is determined to do so. Another reason is that she’s trying to tell us that there is a future for the hibiscus. How is when she says “…and this hibiscus is budding,” that the hibiscus has a chance to change and get use to its surroundings, just like the girl in the story will be doing. Last reason is that it tells us that she is and will be doing her best. When she says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought were strange…, almost familiar to her now,” @CAPS1 trying to get use to her surroundings and now realizes she can.

6625	10184	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because is symbolizes the hope that things will get better. The author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year. So can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will. This is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note. The girl spends the entire day wishing that she were back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends. But this paragraph is the girl vowing a promise to her self that she will withstand the winter until spring and it will get better when she can take the test again. The entire story builds up to this turning point when Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter. Saeng realizes that it is going to take time for her to adapt to this new and strange country and the new lifestyle that she must adopt	3	3		3																						207	9	215	0	0	0	4.396135265700483	23.0	44	31	12	5	9	9	127	10.8	8.3	6.91	20	8.7	10.55	8.666666666666666	9.4	269
6626	10185	4	The author concludes this story with this sentence, because it shows hope for the future. This sentence lets readers know that times are hard now, but in time things will get better. Saeng might have failed this test, but shes not giving up hope on passing it. She believes she will pass that test in the spring, when the time is right. Saeng might miss her home, but she won’t tell that interfer with her future. That is why the author concludes the story with “when they comeback, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return andthis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that tests again.	2	1		2																						115	6	131	9	0	0	4.530434782608696	19.166666666666668	29	19	4	5	4	16	63	9.5	8.24	7.61	10	6.1	8.38	7.5	6.4	140
6631	10190	4	The author concludes the story this way with a quote that says she will get another try at something. Many authors end stories at a diff way because it makes the reader wants to go on to a sequal or the next story, and I really adds a twist to the ending. Also another reason a author would end like that is because they want you to work your imagination so you picture what happens next.

Even though it @MONTH1 not be right away, Saeng wants to try to see all of the flowers that remind her of home again without breaking down. She can tell that although her mother is understanding, Saeng has let her down a little bit. “But how could you? You know how much we–what happened?” when her mother says this, she feels that she has let her mother down. But then, Mrs. Panouvong expresses that she is glad Saeng got it, after hearing that she had failed. Sensing her mother’s inkling of disappointment, Saeng wants to try again.	2	2		2																						114	7	127	6	0	2	4.508771929824562	16.285714285714285	20	22	4	8	1	19	66	8.0	7.77	7.22	12	6.1	7.57	7.666666666666666	6.9	143

I think she ends the story say that because in the spring the hibiscus plant that she got and her and her mom planted, will be growing and blooming and the geese will be back with makes her feel more at home. That way she will feel comfort and be able to take the test and pass, because it will remind her of being home.	2	2		2																						88	4	94	2	0	0	4.0	22.0	15	17	4	3	8	9	55	8.4	5.51	6.7	4	7.2	9.25	11.5	7.2	102
6645	10204	4	"Authors sometimes conclude a story with a certain paragraph describing an action that will take place in the future. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the paragraph by saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” One reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to help show that things will change come spring. For example in the story the girl saids “I-I failed the test.” By her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change. She can get better, so that this time she will pass. Also, “The ""winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and @CAPS1 tamped down the soil around it.” This quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now, but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed. In conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future."	2	2		2																						185	9	202	8	0	0	4.616216216216216	20.555555555555557	45	38	4	7	6	23	101	15.7	9.47	7.64	17	11.8	13.18	18.0	9.3	238
6647	10206	4	The reason why the aurthor wanted to put that last paragraph down because they want to keep the reader interested in the story.

6656	10215	4	The author minFong @CAPS1 concludes the story with this paragraph to envoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessions anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try. Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that “never giving up is important” is presented and carried out hopefully through the character’s vow. This principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with. In conclusion, hope is envoked within the reader because of the ending paragraph which contributes to the over all theme of the entire story; it is important to never give up and always have hope especially when life gets hard.	2	2		2																						149	5	158	3	0	0	4.885906040268456	29.8	35	22	8	12	4	18	81	16.5	11.27	8.61	23	13.7	14.34	14.75	13.0	218
6657	10216	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sounds better and it makes the story sound a bit more better when the author put that paragraph in the start. If the author did not put that ending at the end of the story the story probably wouldnt be that intresting and be that good of a story if the author didn’t put that ending paragraph at the end of the story. Also the author wants to make the reader understand the story end end or the start all at the same time. For example if there were no good ending at the end of this story no body would want to read at all not a bit so it was a good thing for the author to put a good end stable ending paragraph at the end of the story. I think ic it was a very good paragraph for the end of the story. It just really seemed to mach the story and I could also really understand it a lot better because of the ending paragraph. It was just the perfect ending for this story.	0	0		0																						189	9	197	0	0	0	3.9576719576719577	21.0	43	24	11	12	4	5	116	10.7	5.75	6.23	7	10.3	11.43	13.5	8.8	246
6664	10223	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. So when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test.

Throughout the essay, Saeng is depressed she had to leave her homeland so hurriedly losing her childhood and beloved grandmother, “A blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone.” as Saeng narrates in deeper detail. Also contributing to the feelings of sorrow in the story is how much saeng cries remembering her tragic past. Im both the greenhouse, recalling the events of her grandmother such as when she says, “Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it."" and in the garden, when she talks to her mother and plants the flower.

6727	10286	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, “Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,” This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, “Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person.	2	2		2																						141	5	155	12	0	0	4.73758865248227	28.2	38	17	11	7	4	17	74	18.5	10.11	8.3	21	14.7	17.24	15.25	13.8	202
6736	10295	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagein what rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example when the author said “then I will take that test again.” Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story.

I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home.

When Saeng says “I – I failed the test” this shows that saeng feels disappointe that she didn’t  expect that because she is a fighter, So the author ends the passage with saeng saying” When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To show how much of a fighter Saeng is because she’s determined to strive under difficult conditions.	2	2		2																						127	6	137	5	0	0	4.421875	21.333333333333332	28	27	8	5	3	19	68	15.4	8.66	8.45	12	12.2	14.61	13.5	11.2	162

Also maybe because they are not very mistful of people even themself. One day I was  like that I didn’t want to talk to anybody. All I want to do is sit in my room and think.

The geese and the  hibiscus symbolize saeng’s determination, because they always come back no matter what. Saeng will be back to take the test , just like the geese will also be back. The hibiscus also symbolize her because it has faced adversity also. It has been taken to new paces and had new homes, much like saeng , and has a harsh winter coming in the near future.  However , it  always  finds a way to come back and bloom in the spring, which is what saeng hopes to do by taking the driver’s test.

6818	10377	4	The author of “winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.”Saeng, because it creates the mood that Saeng is accepting the changes. Just like nature adapts to climate and location change, saeng seems to appreciate her situation and is deciding her situation and is deciding to make it a positive instead of a negative. The author is showing that if your having trouble, try again; through the main character, Saeng.	2	2		2																						95	3	106	7	0	0	4.821052631578947	31.666666666666668	25	15	5	5	5	15	51	17.1	10.51	8.7	15	13.3	16.47	19.833333333333332	14.6	137

Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph	1	1		1																						118	4	126	6	0	0	4.389830508474576	29.5	24	20	3	9	5	11	74	18.9	8.31	7.33	6	13.9	16.06	25.5	6.4	142

Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can survive through hard times and adapt to changes, and survive she can also.

6830	10389	4	The last paragraph was added in order to represent the determinedness and adapting to new things in Saeng and her family. In the beginning, Saeng held bitterness at failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, she will be a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her being determined to deal with it is that she does make friends, and, though the food she offered was rejected she didn’t give in. The moment of breakdown was as she got the flower. After she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change.	2	1		2																						112	7	123	4	0	0	4.375	16.0	23	18	3	4	6	13	70	7.2	7.25	7.39	14	6.0	8.9	8.833333333333334	9.6	149
6836	10395	4	I thinks that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that she is similar to the hibiscus and geese. First, the geese and hibiscus both have a goal, which is to survive the winters. Geese fly south for the winter to stay warm. This is similar to Saeng worse thing both moved to a different environment where they must adapt. Also, Saeng must experience winter along with the hibiscus. The hibiscus needs tobe strong, to overcome winter, from this, it shows Saeng is like her hibiscus because she needs to be strong to overcome the test. If her hibiscus can overcome it’s test, winter then she can survive to cangner her own.	2	3		3																						116	7	130	7	0	0	4.594827586206897	16.571428571428573	25	19	10	4	2	17	63	8.5	8.35	6.91	10	7.4	8.02	9.0	10.3	158

6844	10403	4	I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasn’t ready for before but now whenever the geese return and the hibiscus return the she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasn’t mentally prepared. So inconclusion I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return the she will take the test and maybe she wasn’t physicaly and mentally prepared for it.	1	1		1																						71	3	74	0	0	0	4.507042253521127	23.666666666666668	10	12	5	8	5	6	43	11.6	8.88	7.04	6	10.2	12.3	14.5	12.5	99
6847	10406	4	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese that flew down south in a beautiful @CAPS1 formation, fly down every season. So she tells herself, @CAPS2, she will take the test again when the geese return and the hibiscus plant is budding. For example, she thinks to herself, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” @CAPS2, looking up at the geese she is almost reminded of an experience she went through somewhat similar.	1	1		1																						103	4	115	9	0	0	4.902912621359223	25.75	20	15	8	11	1	14	60	18.8	10.86	8.4	17	15.5	17.99	20.333333333333332	14.6	154
6853	10412	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph that she did because it was the end and the start of a new beggining. The author uses the sensens in her story. The winter is the current season and spring is on its way. Although Saeng failed her test in the winter when most things die, she is looking forward to spring to start again on her test. The geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life. Saeng will also have new life in her test to pass it this time and drive.

6888	10448	4	I think the author concludes this story wit this ending paragraph because the story is all about how  she feels comforted in the plants and she wants to wait until the weather breaks and the geese to come back to take her test.

6911	10471	4	The author is very creative. He concludes the story saying how the hibiscus is building and that she will take the test agian. She believes that she will do better when the snow is gone. The author ended the story with that because Saeng was very upset failing a test but with the comfort of the hibiscus she’ll be able to do better.

Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too.

The hibiscus is a plant that thrives in warm, tropical climates. However it does not survive in the cold; only the winter hibiscus, which can survive in both climates (warm and cold) can. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. She lived in Vietnam and loved it with all the pretty flowers and being with her grandmother. However now that she is living in the United States, she is finding it hard to adapt. Now that she has this hibiscus flower, which adapts to the cold weather magnificently, she can adjust to her new life in the United States.

6944	10504	4	The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.	3	2		3																						83	4	89	2	0	0	5.178571428571429	21.0	26	12	4	2	2	12	46	13.6	12.65	9.04	14	10.2	11.69	13.125	12.6	125
6952	10512	4	The author most likely concludes the story with that paragraph because they are trying to show the reader that even though you fail at something, you can’t be stubborn. So Saeng failed her drivers test but in the spring when the hibiscus plant starts to bud she will go back and take the test again. By the plant budding she thinks of that as a sign that she will pass the test	1	1		1																						72	3	75	1	0	0	4.25	24.0	14	13	1	7	2	5	46	10.6	7.43	7.46	7	7.9	10.16	12.333333333333334	6.4	86
6959	10520	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn’t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story.	2	2		2																						119	6	126	1	0	0	4.512605042016807	19.833333333333332	22	20	4	7	3	11	72	11.7	8.88	7.6	11	9.0	9.52	13.0	6.7	153
6961	10522	4	The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason @MONTH1 be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. “Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too but they come back every year. Along with the flower Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do. She won’t give up but try again later on in the year. This shows how she is adapting and changing to work with her new surrondings.	3	2		3																						154	10	166	2	0	0	4.207792207792208	15.4	29	27	10	6	10	14	93	7.0	6.32	6.64	11	5.2	7.36	7.833333333333334	6.9	189
6969	10530	4	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph about geese to show that Saeng is going to try to overcome her obstacles. She was @CAPS1 disappointed in failing the test so she took comfort in memories of her homeland. She bought a hibiscus that she saw in her homeland a lot, and that flower @CAPS2 comfort and affection. But it also @CAPS2 her ability to come over obstacles, and while she was planting her hibiscus, and saw the geese flying above, she knew she had to try again.	2	1		2																						89	4	97	4	0	0	4.550561797752809	22.25	18	16	4	4	5	11	50	11.1	8.71	7.76	16	9.6	12.52	13.625	12.2	127

6979	10542	4	The author concludes the story with this piece because she said “a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,” I think she means that even tho the geese flew over with their heads up high even tho Saeng’s wasn’t. “Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time.

6997	10560	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and next time that time of year comes back around she will have another chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didn’t even cost that much. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																						71	3	74	0	0	0	4.28169014084507	23.666666666666668	16	11	3	2	1	6	46	10.6	7.55	7.26	4	7.8	10.04	12.5	7.8	86
6999	10562	4	The author included this because she was showing that it was winter and the flower was goin to bloom and the geese were flying here because it is cold.

7005	10568	4	There are many reasons the author says “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again .” @CAPS1 the author said this because the girl left everything just to come to this country and she can not fail. The gil said  “That at last , she could hold on to. But where was the fine-foothed come? the hibiscus hedge? She also said this because the hedge was all she had from her old home besides her mother and when the “hibiscus is budding” means its starting a new life and is starting to grow leafs and the girl is starting grow and move on with her life.	2	2		2																						130	6	142	5	0	2	4.190839694656488	21.833333333333332	23	22	7	8	8	18	78	14.7	7.38	6.95	6	11.2	13.23	13.25	8.1	157
7014	10577	4	In my opinion the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was feeling down about not passing her driving test but when she saw those flowers she realize when she came to @CAPS1 she  forget all about her home town. So she decied to get back in touch with a nature side and hold off taking her test intill the spring instead of rushing things.	1	1		1																						67	2	70	0	0	0	4.352941176470588	34.0	16	14	0	4	2	7	38	16.0	8.6	8.83	13	12.8	14.0	17.25	0.0	88

7035	10599	4	The author concludes with this paragraph te emphasize the new beginning that saeng is looking for. She was so disappointed when she failed her driver’s test. &the hibiscus was the thing to make her happy. she needed a new beginning to start over in a new country &the flower, the flower the snow , the geese, & the test all symbolize new beginnings &challenges to overcome , the geese & snow represent a change in season, the budding hibiscus  represent new life,& the passing of the test represent a milestone in saeng’s life .

7036	10600	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to explain to the reader that she isn’t done gardening, that she’ll  go back when it blooms once again. also she isn’t done. she’d rather garden than go to school. This is what the author concludes about the story with the last paragraph.	0	0		0																						51	4	57	1	0	0	4.596153846153846	13.0	11	9	1	7	0	9	33	13.3	9.52	7.38	3	9.7	10.98	13.25	0.0	68
7043	10607	4	The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means.	1	1		1																						101	6	112	4	0	0	3.6435643564356437	16.833333333333332	14	19	3	8	4	10	70	4.1	2.96	1.61	3	3.9	7.51	7.833333333333334	7.2	112

7050	10614	4	The story of “Winter Hibiscus” is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. Saeng misses her homeland but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, and pass her drivers test. The story is nicely concluded with Saeng's promise to herself that come spring, she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleinates some home-sickness. Saeng’s promise indicates that she is comng to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become.. - Almost familiar to her now.” I feel that was a landmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that by allows to change.	3	3		3																						146	10	161	4	0	0	4.876712328767123	14.6	36	23	6	9	5	21	83	13.8	10.8	9.08	28	10.4	13.27	9.0	12.2	206

Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life. The mood also shows how that somthing small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in.	2	2		2																						143	4	151	2	0	0	4.1678321678321675	35.75	25	18	9	9	9	7	101	22.0	7.45	7.99	10	18.4	20.2	28.5	13.0	181
7100	11848	5	In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat mood. He clearly is very grateful for his family, and had a happy childhood. He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negitive for him while growing up, but then he cancelled those negitive things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story, have an upbeat and happy mode. He even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others.	2	3		2																						177	8	198	10	0	0	4.3107344632768365	22.125	31	26	13	15	11	19	114	9.9	7.08	7.05	21	9.5	10.65	15.25	11.5	245

7705	12453	5	This story, basically, brings me back memories myself. In the memoir, the author feels a happy, strong, lovable mood. He feels as @CAPS1 those times, are never going to be forgettable, that he's always going to remember those times. That once he gets older, he will take these good times, as granted. Even during bad times, he will look back. Also he will always be thankful, for what his parents have done, to make his life better, and esier. That way he wouldn't have to life a hard depressed life. Hopefully he will always be thankful for that oppertunity, that his parents gave him. I know that @CAPS1 my parents did that for me, I would never forget them.	1	1		1																						119	9	145	15	0	0	4.554621848739496	13.222222222222221	18	18	11	12	1	23	75	6.6	6.89	6.68	13	6.1	7.3	6.125	8.2	164

Also it  was nearly deserted, almost all of the places he crossed were deserted .A  lost her features of the setting were a ram shackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that caldnt hald in the lamest move.an is the feature give you an idea if haw the cyclist feels.	1	1		1																						70	4	79	4	0	0	4.361111111111111	18.0	17	9	6	4	2	12	38	11.2	8.13	8.63	10	10.0	11.03	13.333333333333334	10.5	96
3589	5984	3	The cyclist was riding through a tower when he stopped for directions. These old men told him to take a short cut and he did and got lost. He was in a ghost town in the desert.

3596	5991	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Initially, when the cyclist went through the road with the big snake in the middle of it made him keep cations and very unease. Furthermore, the desert and nothing around gave the cyclist of abandoness and no help for when he is I trouble. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and that people are there.

3624	6020	3	The setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” He uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting. He describes the intense heat inthe desert of California, pedaling up, “ one long, crippling hill.” The terrain did not make his rideeasy at all. The factor of weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water take a tall on him. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine.	2	2		2																						132	6	147	10	0	0	4.356060606060606	22.0	35	16	9	8	3	22	73	12.3	7.49	8.3	19	10.0	12.08	18.333333333333332	8.8	173

He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. “This sight was troubling” when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. “At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.” He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived."	3	3		3																						205	13	226	7	0	0	4.351219512195122	15.76923076923077	50	29	20	5	11	26	110	16.1	7.85	7.95	22	13.1	14.85	8.166666666666666	10.5	258
3636	6032	3	The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						71	6	82	2	0	0	4.464788732394366	11.833333333333334	18	12	2	2	0	9	42	5.5	6.89	6.67	9	6.7	6.41	6.083333333333333	9.3	103
3643	6039	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						119	9	135	2	0	0	4.258333333333334	13.333333333333334	27	16	11	8	2	16	72	7.3	6.38	7.53	14	6.4	8.14	8.166666666666666	8.4	152
3645	6041	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because the roads are too rough. If he gos too pot he could spin out of commission and the water was trouble.

3654	6050	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist’s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, “ I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph” This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story.	3	3		3																						336	20	377	21	0	0	4.553571428571429	16.8	81	35	28	25	9	47	198	9.3	8.41	6.96	36	8.2	9.15	8.833333333333334	9.6	470
3655	6051	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty “….

This side was troubling. “when she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be @NUM1 degrees. “Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. “This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. It was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding	1	1		1																						148	11	165	7	0	0	4.261744966442953	13.545454545454545	35	21	17	2	3	24	78	8.1	7.08	7.88	18	5.7	7.63	10.2	6.0	183
3662	6058	3	The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the “town” had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this “town” is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road.	2	1		2																						132	8	143	3	0	0	4.143939393939394	16.5	32	14	5	8	2	14	85	6.3	5.91	7.09	12	5.0	7.81	6.714285714285714	7.2	163
3669	6065	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, “Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.”	2	2		2																						110	8	124	8	0	0	4.6	13.75	31	13	4	3	4	19	63	8.1	8.23	7.14	13	7.1	8.83	8.0	10.9	153
3682	6078	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The cyclist also had a lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map.	2	2		2																						78	5	83	0	0	0	4.089743589743589	15.6	21	11	3	3	4	5	44	5.6	5.8	6.64	8	5.8	8.29	7.800000000000001	8.8	101
3688	6084	3	There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, “several rusty bumps,” is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn’t riding on smooth ground he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also he had a huge lack of water he was water depleted he couldn’t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. “Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,''  this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehidrated, and very tired.	3	2		3																						107	4	123	10	0	0	4.611111111111111	27.0	26	16	8	5	2	20	55	13.8	9.06	9.25	15	11.4	13.71	14.75	12.6	151
3694	6090	3	There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	1		1																						87	4	95	3	0	0	4.137931034482759	21.75	14	11	6	8	2	8	61	8.9	6.27	7.08	7	7.1	10.1	11.625	8.1	107
3699	6095	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man’s journey he was confident in his abilities. “I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.”  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June” without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey."	3	3		3																						235	11	262	11	0	0	4.711864406779661	21.454545454545453	68	33	12	9	12	35	124	20.4	10.11	9.01	35	16.1	18.51	19.333333333333332	14.1	332

3716	6112	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in most of the story. The heat made him hot & thirsty while the travel gave him a lack of energy and even     of a need for water. In paragraph @NUM1 the writer says one of the hills was “long and a               “ The hill was wearing him out & draining what was left of his energy.

3721	6117	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Ti’s better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing what’s going to happen next.	1	1		1																						125	11	138	1	0	0	4.388888888888889	11.454545454545455	26	20	8	6	5	14	72	5.1	6.59	6.6	10	5.4	5.52	5.777777777777778	8.8	170
3722	6118	3	As the features changed in the setting it becomes harder for the cyclist .At first the cyclist stoned off pretty easy .He had plat smooth roads to go through .He started out before the sun could to him.” The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite my name written all it “He kept his mind off the sun and this helped him .Then, he got to a highway that made it kind of harder .I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills “So he had to pedal harder and would tire him faster.” At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path.

3725	6121	3	The features of the setting greatly  effected the cyclist.  He was  riding along   on a  route he had little confidence would end up anywhere. That being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework. The temperature was very hot, where was little shade, the   sun was beating down on him. The route was very discouraging .all the cyclist wanted wanted   was water and the route kept touenting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that approved to be an old bottling factory for Welch’s  grape  juice. The cyclist would appear  to be closing in on something to drink, but be left with nothing.	3	2		3																						146	9	168	4	0	0	4.217948717948718	17.333333333333332	30	21	12	7	5	17	85	9.8	7.83	7.05	18	9.1	9.73	8.0	8.4	208
3734	6130	3	The features of the setting keep affecting the cyclist because first its hopeful then he relizes its hopeless. He was laughting when people told him the right directions and now “It was sad, hopeless laught, mind you, but at least I still had energy to feel bad for self.” said the cyclist when he was refering back to the first town. The reason this affect the cyclist is at first he was going good then he got thirsty and bad things happened.  thats how it affect th cyclist.	1	1		1																						88	4	97	3	0	0	4.382022471910112	22.25	17	15	10	8	3	12	50	14.1	8.43	7.6	10	11.2	13.54	16.0	9.7	115
3736	6132	3	This is how the setting effects the cyclist. One is the hot dry California desert heat. It was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water. The hot desert heat had made water a for like a substance which he could not drink from the well. The water bottle only containe a few tentalizing sips which was not enough to quench his thirst. The hot heat that would make birds pick him drys all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice. It made him realice that in time comes wisely and youth can make silly mistakes. The heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive. That is ho the setting effects the cyclest.	3	3		3																						130	9	139	0	0	0	4.161538461538462	14.444444444444445	30	18	15	3	2	12	75	5.4	5.85	6.9	14	5.4	6.99	6.714285714285714	6.9	163
3740	6136	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster. The road might be up the hill so he @MONTH1 go slow. There could be a possibility that the road might have bump rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through. So the affect of the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made.	1	1		1																						74	5	79	0	0	0	4.081081081081081	14.8	15	9	1	5	1	5	49	5.2	5.33	6.72	7	4.3	7.0	6.8	6.7	90

Along his journey he was aciccted with a lot of things like the sun. The weather condition of their exaction and the big snake he saw. He was affected by sun because he was dehydrating and he almost had no water left for him as it was also becoming so hot alike makes the journey very difficult for and made his mood strange while also following the direction he was disfernded by a big snake he encounter at the case slic desn't while succeed their add was scared that he was going to be attacked unlike anyone to make his way through.

You can imagine how hot it got when it said, “wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down	2	1		2																						67	5	71	1	0	0	4.149253731343284	13.4	12	12	5	4	1	7	38	6.5	6.03	7.3	7	6.3	7.91	7.875	7.2	87
3753	6149	3	The features of the settings in “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through todi, California which is a rough area to ride. The ride was hot and long that he was so dehidrated that sweat was dried around his neck. The solo cyclist says “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” He had no where to get water or food. It was deserted. He thought if he died no one would find him faster the birds would pick him clean. The essay “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by @PERSON1 shows a solo cycilist are very independent.	2	2		2																						119	7	131	4	0	0	4.294117647058823	17.0	33	15	9	4	4	21	62	7.3	6.67	7.93	19	6.4	8.82	8.166666666666666	8.4	152
3759	6155	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a lot of ways. in the essay, the author describe how the setting is hot, it is bumpy, it makes him sweat, it makes him tired, he is also, running out of water from his thirst. The road gets, very rocky at one point. The narrator states “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (Kurmaskie @NUM1). There is also a photograph that shows how rough the terrain is. It is barrain with nothing around it.	1	1		1																						85	6	101	8	0	0	4.376470588235295	14.166666666666666	20	11	8	3	0	17	47	7.7	6.67	8.01	10	6.4	8.68	8.3	8.2	108
3761	6157	3	The settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the ‘@CAPS1 town” he isn’t really warried he is kind of laughing and thinks his funny by saying.” This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time  - say, before the last world war.” Then after he says that it ways he chuckled. When he gets the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water he begins to switch into conservation made and begins to get is scared. He says.” I would comer  water- a test at my inner spirit “ This showing that he was scared. After he sees the abanoned Grape juice factory he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind same expensive biking gear. This definatly shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction. When he finally reaches the balt shop he is releved and goes to the bathrom and drinks water. He  also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn’t have a rod. These examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist.	3	2		3																						209	12	223	1	0	0	4.183962264150943	17.666666666666668	39	38	15	10	5	24	119	9.0	6.91	7.93	21	7.9	9.28	13.0	8.8	271
3765	6161	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, the road could be bumpy, and the town could be deserted. For example, ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty. And if he is not and with no water he probably could  barely make it up the hills. And with no town for water he would be thirsty.""First ""town"" This place might have been a thriving little spot at one point but anthor warning it fit the outsides of ghost town"" No waters"	2	2		2																						99	8	113	3	0	0	4.217821782178218	12.625	26	7	7	2	5	14	58	8.7	6.79	7.49	15	7.5	9.13	10.5	7.6	126
3772	6168	3	As the reader listened and followed the directions of the old-timers he faced many issues and also learned a leason. As he began to ride into the day break of morning he had strong legs and even a smile on his face. As time went on he soon became close out of water and a loss of energy. The @CAPS1 summer day made him sweat and began to think that he birds would pluk at his body as if he would die on his ride to Yosemite. When he finally got to a town he soon refreashed and learned that he would and start to began to follow his own way: of getting to places	2	2		2																						115	5	122	0	0	0	3.8956521739130436	23.0	25	22	5	5	7	9	66	8.4	5.23	6.84	8	7.5	10.24	10.8	8.2	141
3773	6169	3	The features of the setting in the essay “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn’t make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far , I’d be fine”. He seemed unsure and a little nervous. As the journey continued, the cyclist loses hope it seems. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary” He does not see himself finishing this journey the more and more he rides in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except “Rough Road Ahead” signs.	2	2		2																						175	10	192	9	0	0	4.36	17.5	41	27	10	9	7	27	102	10.1	7.54	8.08	24	8.3	10.56	11.0	9.2	232
3774	6170	3	The features in the setting are very effective to the cyclist. He is in a desert area of California and he has limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry. He barely had an water to drink and he had to go a long way in the hot and humid weather. The deficiency of water could have made him became dehydrated. Another obstacle that he had during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park was the hills that he faced. At the beginning, he was on flat terrain, now he has hills that he has to pedal up that makes it a lot harder for him. One other obstacle that he faced was the snake he ran into. That setting had many obstacles for this guy. If it wasn't for the heat and lack of water, he might have been able to make it a little easier.	1	1		1																						149	10	163	3	0	0	4.0	14.9	32	18	13	5	5	13	98	4.9	4.81	6.81	17	5.6	8.38	7.428571428571429	9.4	198
3775	6171	3	"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The rolling hills were the cyclist’s most challenging problem because they were long and cripppling. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatsroke. However, the cyclist kept a possitive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and wilbells fish camp.” In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort. But with determination,you can accomplish anything!"	3	3		3																						152	9	166	4	1	0	5.243421052631579	16.88888888888889	34	27	10	9	9	16	80	12.8	12.59	8.21	27	10.7	11.55	10.666666666666666	12.2	237
3776	6172	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit.” The cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does. The narration states, “ a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit … sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie). Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist making him tired due to lack of water and sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die.	2	1		2																						132	6	142	1	0	0	4.285714285714286	22.166666666666668	32	24	13	5	6	11	60	10.0	7.54	7.51	15	8.2	9.91	7.666666666666666	7.8	173
3778	6174	3	The setting had a huge affect on the cyclist. One affect was the lack of water in the area he was in, which was a dessert. Also, the lack of people in the area didn’t help the cyclist out at all. The hills on the road made it more tougher on the cyclist because it drashed what little energy he had left. Also, the sun beating down on him made his body more warm and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do.	1	2		2																						89	5	97	3	0	0	3.831460674157303	17.8	20	10	4	7	1	9	58	5.5	4.12	7.0	6	5.5	7.57	8.1	5.7	109
3781	6177	3	In the story the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest problems was the terrian that he had to maneuver them. The terrain was hilly, having to go up a hill on a bike is tireing and wears you out faster than flat land would, and making him use more energy. The heat was also unbearable making it harder for him to focus, the cyclist did everything he could to keep consiese while  manuvering threu the terrain and deserted landscape being a huge desert of rolling mountains he pushed forwad, finding no civilization anywhere to get a refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn’t as hilled then it would of made it easier for him using less energy and less strain on his legs, the heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress also. Heat will make you move slower and a cyclist moving down a  barnest road with no shade will make the journey seem longer, and imposible. In the end his will and determination got with threw the landscape, so he could get the water he needed to finish his trip	2	2		2																						190	6	206	9	0	0	4.375	32.0	40	34	13	10	7	22	114	15.2	8.48	8.87	28	13.3	15.21	19.333333333333332	11.9	260

3787	6183	3	The terrain in “Do not exeed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, “I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.	2	3		3																						136	9	155	7	0	0	4.970802919708029	15.222222222222221	43	22	7	8	2	24	68	9.7	10.14	7.75	21	8.0	8.69	6.875	10.7	202

3796	6192	3	The features of the setting that the author cyclist through definitely effect not only his mood, but his the physical condition. To start, it is mentioned that he is in “the high deserts California in June,” @CAPS1 it is implied that the weather is hot causing the author to sweat as he bikes along. Next there is a change in terrain an he soon approaches “rolling hills” which are more difficult to bike on. Finally the author sees a sign that reads “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit but he still has to manage getting past the rough road. After passing this road he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated before. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the author’s change in mood.	3	3		3																						168	8	178	3	0	0	4.636904761904762	21.0	38	27	12	13	5	18	88	12.4	9.52	8.59	28	10.3	12.46	14.5	11.5	235
3800	6196	3	The ways that can effects the cyclist by the setting of the place are how the road is shaped or the riding up the hills and the roughness of the rode. There were an sign where it said “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit.” That sign if he didn’t see it he would have over the speed or didn’t know what the speed he was to go as a cyclist and gotten hurt. The road was made for the cars so the speed limit is hard to	1	1		1																						90	3	93	0	0	0	3.7888888888888888	30.0	22	14	1	1	4	6	56	11.4	5.0	7.41	7	9.1	12.0	15.0	3.1	103
3813	6209	3	This cyclist had the conditions of the land to deal with, He didn’t have too much water with him and there wasn’t a good source anywhere near him that he could see. He just had to keep going. He also talked about how the road was rough. This was conflicting on how long it took him to get to the next place with water. More over he was in a desert area. The air was dry and hot, the heat was making him sweat and that was leading him to become dehydrated.	2	2		2																						92	6	100	2	0	0	3.9565217391304346	15.333333333333334	12	18	6	7	3	10	63	4.9	4.57	6.28	5	4.5	7.42	7.166666666666666	7.2	110
3814	6210	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclist’s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up “Ghost towns” and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says “what I believed was my last burst of energy,” “I was going to die.” The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die.	2	2		2																						121	5	127	2	0	0	4.322314049586777	24.2	25	22	8	1	6	16	68	11.0	7.72	7.97	15	9.2	11.0	13.5	8.8	158
3816	6212	3	It the short story “Rough Rode Ahead” a cyclist is pushed through an extremely harsh setting  trying to get to Yosemite National Park. In the story the narrator takes a trip to Yosemite National park after getting directions from two older men what the narrator doesn't know is that the road ahead is indeed rough. One narrator states “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated @NUM1). The narrator is really really taking a beating from the travel and this rocks, dry climate is really takens a tale. From reading this story the setting does not do any good for him other than the general store he finds in the end. Like the title states the setting of this story was a “Rough Road Ahead.”	2	2		2																						128	6	137	1	0	0	4.4728682170542635	21.5	38	17	9	6	1	12	65	10.4	8.36	7.16	12	9.2	10.08	12.4	11.5	180
3822	6218	3	There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town there wasn’t any real water he could drink. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty. Also, it’s the middle of June in California, it’s very hot and size and the is going to wear him out pretty quickly. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says “Over one long, crippling hill”, he’s saying the hills are very hard for him. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story.	2	1		2																						108	7	121	6	0	0	4.203703703703703	15.428571428571429	21	13	8	12	4	17	64	6.1	6.09	6.59	9	5.8	7.27	6.857142857142857	8.4	141
3826	6222	3	In this paragraph I will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One affect was the uneven, bumpy roads he was trying  to cycle on. If it was flat he wouldn’t have to really be more aware, cause with bumpy roads he has to look out for rocks, holes in the road. Another affect are the hills. He had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat. Those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						90	6	100	3	0	0	4.21978021978022	15.166666666666666	22	11	5	3	0	10	57	6.1	6.26	7.71	11	5.6	7.33	7.333333333333334	8.3	117
3828	6224	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist in many was it was like a crazy maze, the road he was own, and him not really knowing were he was going didn’t help him, or not having enough water.

3840	6236	3	The cyclist in the essay goes through phases that effect him differently according to the setting. At first the cyclist knows where he is and is very familiar with his location. He is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it. He then shows up at a “ghost town.” He begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him. This place was completely deserted and there was no water for him. He began to feel discouraged when he passed the Grape juice factory and he seriously believed this was the end for him. His hope and enjoyment finally returned to him after he saw the sign for the bait. The bikers feelings and attitude changed as often as the setting did.	2	2		2																						127	9	135	0	0	0	4.338582677165355	14.11111111111111	24	19	6	9	6	8	76	7.0	7.19	7.78	20	7.1	9.82	10.166666666666666	10.7	173

3851	6247	3	The harsh setting in “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit “by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to “Yosemite.”	3	2		3																						141	7	146	0	0	0	4.347517730496454	20.142857142857142	42	18	8	4	3	17	77	13.2	7.84	8.06	17	10.7	12.7	18.666666666666668	9.4	183
3853	6249	3	Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources – especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. “I was going to die” he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder.	3	3		3																						201	13	226	13	0	0	4.82089552238806	15.461538461538462	57	25	12	11	3	32	106	11.3	9.86	8.17	31	9.9	10.83	15.75	11.4	295
3864	6260	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in @CAPS1 ways. The cyclist was in California in June weather. If it wasn’t so hot, he wouldn’t have needed water as badly. He wouldn’t have been sweating as much. Also, there weren’t any buildings or cars around, so there wasn’t anyone to help him. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.” @CAPS1 features of the setting could affect the cyclist.	2	1		2																						77	6	89	6	0	0	4.597402597402597	12.833333333333334	24	8	2	6	2	18	43	7.9	7.94	7.48	9	6.9	6.68	6.9	5.7	105

He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake.”…Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades,”(Kurmaskie). The hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated.	2	2		2																						73	5	84	5	0	0	4.824324324324325	14.8	18	9	11	2	3	13	33	8.9	9.45	9.55	17	6.6	9.13	7.699999999999999	9.9	103

3886	6282	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, “Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven’t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. “This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se – a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist.	3	3		3																						194	13	212	3	0	0	4.2	15.0	54	27	12	6	4	26	103	6.5	6.32	7.94	27	6.1	7.72	10.6	7.5	254
3893	6289	3	The conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist. The conditions were that, he had to save as much water as possible and keep himself hydrated at the same time so that he wouldn’t dehydrate himself.The features of the desert like land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there.

3895	6291	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn’t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist.	2	2		2																						96	6	104	2	0	0	4.09375	16.0	19	15	1	5	2	9	61	5.8	5.68	6.57	10	6.0	7.23	7.5	7.2	122
3901	6297	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope and nearly lead him to his death.	1	1		1																						81	6	89	1	0	0	4.506172839506172	13.5	18	11	10	1	3	7	43	6.6	7.76	7.23	11	6.2	6.88	6.916666666666667	9.3	112
3908	6304	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.	1	1		1																						61	5	66	0	0	0	4.229508196721311	12.2	12	8	7	3	1	4	39	4.6	5.9	6.05	5	4.5	6.85	5.9	8.2	81
3910	6306	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because, it is hot, and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle, hot and dry with bad directions, and in a desert is bad. It was a long distance ride, in the burning hot sun, with little water, and he thought he was going to die because there was nothing insight.	1	1		1																						63	2	72	7	0	0	4.174603174603175	31.5	13	6	9	0	4	9	36	14.0	6.69	7.2	8	12.0	13.87	17.25	0.0	83
3912	6308	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says “wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.” The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it.	3	3		3																						200	10	212	2	0	0	4.325	20.0	43	31	11	10	6	19	113	10.1	7.37	8.45	33	8.4	10.68	11.0	9.2	268
3916	6312	3	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist. He starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men. The cyclist is very excited about the thought of a short cut and is drinking his water effectliy. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him. He take pressure in thinking about the cool stress of @CAPS1 and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictious stream had an effect on the cyclist. Soon the sun starts to beat on him even more. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage. When he come over the bend he cave to his troubles road and thirst	1	2		2																						133	8	140	0	0	0	4.090225563909774	16.625	28	20	12	7	6	8	74	6.1	5.8	7.31	18	5.0	7.24	7.833333333333334	6.6	163
3917	6313	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. For example, the author states “looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. For instance in the text, “it didn’t really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.” This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. He would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.	3	2		3																						172	10	183	3	0	0	4.4476744186046515	17.2	38	27	14	8	4	16	99	10.3	8.07	8.01	20	9.3	11.16	12.0	11.0	237
3922	6318	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly in the story. The list desert climate tales damage onto the cyclist by quickly depleting his water supply. He also began to get worried when every town the old men told about turned out to be a ghost town. This crawled doubt in the cyclist mind that he might not survive the “shortcut” told off by the old men.	1	1		1																						68	4	72	0	0	0	4.382352941176471	17.0	19	10	4	3	0	5	34	7.7	7.48	8.19	11	6.4	7.39	7.75	6.0	90
3923	6319	3	The features in the setting effects the cyclist because there it different kinds of hills. He has watch out for rocks in the middle of the road. He has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert. There is no cars around but he still has to look for any cars in case they came out of nowhere. There is a lot of turns. It is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a neat scaoke. There is no places where he can stop because there is no shade. There is no stores where he can stop & get water and food at either. That is the setting of the cyclist.	1	1		1																						126	10	135	0	0	0	3.6825396825396823	12.6	25	19	5	5	3	9	88	3.0	3.18	5.84	3	2.8	5.56	6.285714285714286	5.0	141

For  example when the sign said ,â€� Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.â€� @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated .

3925	6321	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he could have tried  if he drunk the battery taste water. or if he didn’t get enough clean water on time. Driving a bike on in a long distance, with no water or any other supples is very energy consuming. So you have to plan trips like that very wisly.	1	1		1																						63	5	70	1	0	0	4.109375	12.8	17	8	5	4	2	9	36	6.0	5.97	8.43	11	5.9	8.22	7.625	8.1	84

When the terrain began to change, he writes, “sometimes life can feel so cruel”, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically.

3949	6345	3	The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says “have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office” gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite.	2	2		2																						107	5	114	2	0	0	4.158878504672897	21.4	27	12	7	7	4	11	58	8.9	6.38	7.65	14	8.1	10.06	11.2	9.4	141
3956	6352	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says “I noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” This effects the cyclist because it makes him work harded when he is dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says”… in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting flustrated an there’s No cold water. This affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost. He didn’t have a good map.	2	2		2																						143	8	157	5	0	0	4.465277777777778	18.0	34	24	8	4	2	24	73	8.7	7.89	8.5	25	7.9	9.4	8.166666666666666	9.2	197

3966	6362	3	I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain. Some types are not always good for a bike rider because if it’s bumpy then someone could fall off the bike. Also, if it is dark you @MONTH1 not even be able to see where you are going then you could hurt your-self very seriously. That’s why riding a bike is dangerous.

He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, “It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine.

Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, “Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence	3	3		3																						187	11	210	17	0	0	4.385026737967914	17.0	47	33	12	9	9	29	95	12.6	7.61	7.83	18	10.2	11.75	7.833333333333334	8.8	239

To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.	3	3		3																						184	10	207	10	0	0	4.782608695652174	18.4	48	25	15	10	9	28	94	11.3	9.63	8.51	27	8.9	10.55	8.666666666666666	10.0	252

4040	6436	3	The features of the setting been amajor affect of this cyclist  in the  story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but think is a lot like and winding. The cyclist also comes across bumps, non-paved roads that make it hard to meneuver through. Then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story.	2	1		2																						78	5	89	2	0	0	4.15	16.0	19	8	10	3	3	10	44	6.3	6.38	7.85	9	5.8	6.24	7.0	5.7	100

4042	6438	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because I was talking about the exceed posted speed limit. How the speed limit or were it says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. They are trying to say is that, you do what they say you are going to be mesem peoples travel will not work, so make the right choice and do the right thing.	1	1		1																						81	3	88	2	0	0	4.37037037037037	27.0	20	16	3	1	2	9	47	12.7	7.96	8.87	14	10.3	11.29	14.166666666666666	7.8	106
4047	6443	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For instance, If you were cycling in a very cold climate you wouldn’t sweat as much and wouldn’t need to drink as much water, but in the story the cyclist is in a very hot climate and he runs out of water, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sps,wide cings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realizating that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This quote explains that the setting of the cycling plays a huge role in the cyclist. Also, the terrain can affect biker. If one was to ride on a flat terrain is gonna put much wear…and tear on the cyclists body therefore the flat terrain would be easier. All of those reasons explains that the settings affect the cyclist in many  ways.	2	2		2																						149	6	164	5	0	0	4.223684210526316	25.333333333333332	40	20	14	7	5	15	81	13.7	7.85	8.51	21	11.4	12.73	26.0	7.6	195
4054	6450	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3.	2	2		2																						112	5	119	1	0	0	4.026785714285714	22.4	22	16	10	8	3	8	67	8.8	5.87	7.43	15	8.5	10.03	10.6	8.2	147
4069	6465	3	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically.	2	2		2																						79	5	85	0	0	0	4.772151898734177	15.8	22	7	3	6	7	4	46	8.9	9.74	7.22	11	8.3	8.35	8.5	10.4	116
4079	6475	3	The cyclist had very little water. It was very hot. He had a long way to go. The road was very bumpy so he couldn’t go to fast or he’s tire’s might bust. There were know cars in site so if he did break down it would have taken even longer.	1	1		1																						51	5	56	0	0	0	3.7058823529411766	10.2	7	11	5	5	1	8	32	1.1	2.18	6.93	1	1.4	4.08	4.1	3.1	56
4084	6480	3	The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective.” and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don’t have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist.	2	2		2																						177	10	197	8	0	0	4.242937853107344	17.7	34	26	13	14	7	22	111	13.3	7.21	7.15	13	11.3	13.38	29.5	10.9	228

4091	6487	3	In the selection “Do not exceed posted speed limit” there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn’t been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and “crippling hills,” according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn’t empty and deserted.	2	3		3																						148	6	161	8	0	0	4.52027027027027	24.666666666666668	28	25	10	10	4	18	84	12.2	8.71	8.6	23	10.6	11.77	11.4	11.5	204
4099	6495	3	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay “A sea worry “, because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says “my son body-surfs. He says it’s his “job”. That quote was explaining that he’s a body-surfer & it’s his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph.	1	2		2																						71	4	80	1	0	0	4.408450704225352	17.75	26	7	5	1	2	12	30	6.9	7.59	7.75	9	6.3	8.42	7.300000000000001	9.4	100
4100	6496	3	Condition the cyclist is in affect a lot of how they ride. One example of this is, “I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.” @CAPS1 to this fact the cyclist had went into a “dehydrated state” because of not having much water. When your travelling in hot weather areas without much water your body will become dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists diffently.	1	1		1																						71	4	76	1	0	0	4.957746478873239	17.75	20	10	5	1	0	10	37	10.8	10.61	7.63	14	10.2	11.06	11.375	12.2	112
4104	6500	3	In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in.	2	1		2																						74	4	82	4	0	0	4.054054054054054	18.5	16	10	3	5	5	8	45	6.9	5.63	6.9	8	8.1	7.94	9.0	8.1	100
4111	6507	3	The features of the setting affect the authors dispotion as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of the paragraph five the author writes that “I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water. This is similair to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay.	3	3		3																						191	9	204	5	0	0	4.43455497382199	21.22222222222222	47	22	14	11	2	18	108	11.4	8.3	8.62	33	10.3	11.86	12.2	10.4	262
4114	6510	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid.Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist.	2	1		2																						66	5	74	2	0	0	4.492537313432836	13.4	20	10	0	5	1	7	38	8.3	8.23	7.8	8	6.2	7.21	7.5	6.0	84
4117	6513	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).” This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his “shortcut” his running out of water. That’s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men.	2	2		2																						72	4	77	1	0	0	4.888888888888889	18.0	19	10	3	2	2	10	37	19.6	11.04	10.03	16	15.0	17.18	20.5	0.0	103
4118	6514	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily .On top of that he had to pedal a bicicle. So he was thirsty and tired prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																						57	6	62	0	0	0	4.0701754385964914	9.5	14	6	4	3	2	7	35	3.4	4.5	6.97	9	4.2	7.37	5.5	8.2	76
4120	6516	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn’t prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the “high deserts of colifornia in June” I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a “ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back” That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to “ease post” it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was “replaced by short, rolling hills” which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?"	3	3		3																						248	9	276	12	0	1	4.289156626506024	27.666666666666668	53	36	24	14	6	35	141	16.5	7.61	7.81	25	13.6	15.61	17.666666666666668	10.3	329

4146	6542	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit” the features of the setting affects the cyclist a great deal. Each feature causing the cyclist to act. For example, in reaching the ‘ramshackle shed’ the cyclist finds the water inusuable; which causes to conserve water and try to head for the next town. That action leads him deeper into the high deserts of California during June. Also as the terrain changes from flat road to short, rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every ‘shack or building he comes across for water. In this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot.	2	2		2																						143	7	154	2	0	0	4.685314685314685	20.428571428571427	44	21	8	4	3	17	67	10.9	9.46	8.62	24	8.9	9.56	8.166666666666666	8.0	195
4147	6543	3	The cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is about a great adventure gone bad. He has every thing he needs but some how it turns out bad. He get low on water & the setting is horrible. He is on his way from a camp ground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite river. He gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns & was running out of water then he came to a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He was pedeling over hills & becoming dehydrated when he tought he was going to die he came to a bait shop & got waiter & met an old guy who was going to give him direction & he decided he better stick to the map.

4148	6544	3	Heat, hills and ghost towns – all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, the heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke. He starts dinking more often, and nearly runs out of water. Next is the hills. They can take massive amounts of energy to climb. Which adds to his dehydration. Finally the ghost towns. They make his journey seem hopeless.

4170	6566	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the “town” The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp…” (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.	3	2		3																						130	11	152	5	0	0	4.507575757575758	12.0	35	22	8	7	3	25	67	6.1	7.35	7.74	17	5.5	6.57	6.0	8.6	177
4178	6575	3	The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the dessert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1. In conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which affects his entire journey.	3	2		3																						204	11	222	8	0	0	4.387254901960785	18.545454545454547	47	30	18	13	10	19	111	9.4	7.6	7.13	16	7.7	9.14	6.857142857142857	7.9	266
4185	6582	3	"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																						145	6	161	4	0	0	4.23448275862069	24.166666666666668	26	27	10	7	2	14	91	10.6	6.91	7.34	15	9.2	10.78	13.5	8.8	191

4218	6615	3	The cyclist and his journey in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit were impacted by the setting. The “deserts of California in June” caused him to be weary very easily. The terrain change from the flat road to hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT Exceed 55 mph. He could only go @NUM1. Finally, the large snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist. All of these features affected the cyclist in some way.	3	2		3																						98	6	106	1	0	0	4.448979591836735	16.333333333333332	27	14	4	6	1	10	52	7.7	7.71	8.15	17	7.3	9.79	8.666666666666666	10.1	135

4226	6623	3	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again.	2	2		2																						157	10	173	2	0	0	4.180124223602484	16.1	38	26	12	8	7	14	79	6.4	6.61	7.03	13	5.9	7.04	5.5	6.7	200
4229	6626	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, he was in the california desert in June.The heat and lack of water can cause people to become dehydrated,passout or even die.There are not many sources of water in the deserts.The terrain didn’t help him much either, hills use a lot of energy and  made him perspore,causing him to lose flood from his body.

4239	6636	3	The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist’s anger. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, “one ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” All of sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to becom frightened and neurotic. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, “the water wouldn’t cool down” and “it had the flavor of battery acid. The cyclist’s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought “had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting.	3	2		3																						152	6	168	11	0	0	4.723684210526316	25.333333333333332	44	25	9	1	6	29	73	16.0	10.05	9.82	25	12.8	14.0	14.75	12.0	211
4242	6639	3	The features of the setting that affect cyclist depends where they are located. In this story the feeling on “nothing and the desert around him and the heat gave him no hope”. It all depends on where you are cycling. “It didn’t really matter I was going to die.” This quote states his feelings on what was going on through his head while he was dieing of thirst. He felt nothing he was sure he was going to die until he found a sign of civilization that was near and he became better and his hope was raised.	2	2		2																						98	5	102	0	0	0	4.1938775510204085	19.6	18	17	3	2	4	9	60	10.6	6.97	7.27	9	9.3	10.62	13.0	8.1	125

4260	6657	3	"In the short story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story. In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike. Being unware of where he is on his journey the setting begins to really affect him. For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that ""The sight was troubling."" As he continues to California in June the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. For example he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" The quote shows because he is biking so long is looking water and there is not a town is sight he becomes weak and although he is at terminated to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in."	3	3		3																						184	7	196	1	0	0	4.282608695652174	26.285714285714285	36	30	9	8	8	11	110	11.9	7.49	8.12	24	11.2	12.26	11.2	10.6	252

For example, in the beginning he came across a deserted town so he was cautious. Next, he came across a fork in the road which was troubling to him. Then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined. Finally, his determination changed to relief where he reached Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey.	2	2		2																						108	6	118	4	0	0	4.796296296296297	18.0	31	15	3	5	3	13	58	10.2	9.63	8.92	21	8.0	9.79	8.666666666666666	10.1	153
4263	6660	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed Limit,” is about a man that follows some bad directions and in the middle of a desert is stuck without water. He starts to lack confidence in the directions when the setting changes. He said, “After fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.” He had been told this was a thriving town but was left with nothing. This was a big let down and the cyclist wasn’t so positive this had been the right choice. He keeps on riding and finds another dissetling sight.” One ramshacle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that wouldn’t  hold in the lamest of mule greeted me.“ @CAPS1 was another place said to be good but all he got was battery flavored water. On the last strech of his bike met with rough rolling hills, a diamondback looking snake, and an abandoned juice factory. All of this brang his spirits lower and lower until he thought he would die. The cyclist ended up finding a store but he was discauraged by the environment he was in a hot and could have died.	1	1		1																						201	9	218	8	0	0	4.400990099009901	22.444444444444443	46	30	17	3	10	28	106	12.0	8.01	8.57	30	9.5	11.43	14.0	10.1	267
4265	6662	3	Features of the setting such as the hot sun, no water, and “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp,” greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high desserts of California in June, the temperature was really high and the hot sun left “wide rings of dried sweat” on his shirt and made the cyclist realize that he could drop from a heatstroke. Also, the fact that the only water around felt “somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees” and “had the flavor of battery acid” prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a “dehydrated state.” @CAPS1, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp” affected the cyclist by solving his problem of dehydration, since there was cold water availible for him upon arrival.	2	2		2																						125	3	136	7	0	0	4.872	41.666666666666664	36	18	9	3	7	22	65	22.3	11.27	9.12	21	17.2	19.24	19.666666666666668	14.1	179
4268	6665	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways. He was biking in the middle of the summer in a very hot state of California. This affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated. The roads are very hilly so, he has to use alot more energy to get up the hills. That’s why I think the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed.”	2	1		2																						100	6	107	2	0	0	4.29	16.666666666666668	21	15	5	8	4	10	56	8.8	7.08	7.47	13	8.7	10.4	11.6	10.4	138
4279	6676	3	In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, “This sight was troubling,” he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die.	2	2		2																						119	4	128	7	0	0	4.218487394957983	29.75	26	22	5	5	4	13	65	18.3	7.27	8.39	10	15.2	15.88	17.666666666666668	9.7	149
4280	6677	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he had some troubles, the fact that there was not much civilization affected the cyclist because he was not able to refill his water bottles, so he grew very thirsty. Also, the many hills and the fact that it is summer impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast. When it says, “A tar like substance oozed out Wouldn’t cool down,” it showed how he wasn’t able to drink. Also, when he passed the grape juice factory, it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty. If he hadn’t taken the advice of the men in the first place he would have had a much shorter ride and would not have been so exhausted. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay.	3	3		3																						170	8	187	11	0	0	4.288235294117647	21.25	38	22	11	13	4	22	100	10.9	7.26	7.91	23	9.2	11.37	14.0	9.6	222
4287	6684	3	the setting affects the cyclist very strongly in the story because mentally and physically he wasn’t ready for where he was going. For example the text states “No a better, piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never. Accept traver advice from a collection of old timers who wasn’t left the cosines of theer poiches since calter was in office.” So a youg guy took maid advice from older guys about how to get to a pack backin thier day it probably was a shortcut.	1	1		1																						87	4	91	1	0	0	4.425287356321839	21.75	24	10	8	6	1	12	42	13.9	8.66	9.61	15	12.2	13.9	16.166666666666668	10.5	121
4294	6691	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if it’s raining or snowing it affects the cyclist because pavement can be wet and icy. Which causes the cyclist to slip and @DATE1 and the cyclist can really get injured. Also the cyclist has to wear a helmet if it’s very hot outside you wouldn’t see the cyclist in winter clothes. This would make the cyclist unfocus and the cyclist wouldn’t be able to finish any race.	1	1		1																						77	4	81	0	0	0	4.532467532467533	19.25	21	12	4	3	5	7	42	9.5	8.65	7.26	9	8.5	8.24	10.125	7.2	107
4297	6694	3	The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he’s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he’s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that there’s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved.	3	3		3																						159	6	178	12	0	0	4.723270440251572	26.5	27	24	14	13	9	23	90	14.1	9.64	8.23	21	11.3	12.61	12.0	11.5	220
4303	6700	3	The cyclist is affected by @NUM1 couple different things. First, he is given directions that are out of date and then he has to deal with the heat of the weather in the early summer of California. If that wasn’t enough, he then runs out of water, which he needs very badly. He runs into a couple more problems, like seeing a big snake and coming to a factory that used to make juice and it was now run down and empty. After all of these obsticles, the cyclist pulls through and makes it to @NUM1 fishing store, where he gets water.	2	2		2																						102	5	113	6	0	0	4.215686274509804	20.4	20	16	6	8	5	13	62	8.6	6.44	7.28	8	7.7	9.73	11.2	9.4	134
4316	6713	3	In this pasage the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been any were else he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the seting had botha lack of civillesation and water that he needed that caused him to almost faint of thirst. This is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist, “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” This showes that had all the setting been paridice he would never learned anything.	2	1		2																						87	4	92	2	0	0	4.494252873563219	21.75	18	11	2	5	3	13	58	14.2	9.01	8.34	11	11.1	14.36	16.5	11.2	114

When the cyclist got directions to Yosemite from these two ??? old people, he thought he was getting a good shortcut. In reality, he was just led on a road that seemed to head nowhere where he saw many things that added to his feeling of hopelessness, for example, the author writes, “ I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds crossed my path and an adversely large snake. It really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This shows that the cyclist is getting tired and seeing tumbleweeds, which usually represents a phase being completely deserted and deadly snakes that get in his way.

4373	6770	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhausting. The heat @MONTH1 cause the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal. This is especially true in this case because of his lack of water. The cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke. The terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road. His muscle will start to ocha and his body will need water and rest. The story would totaly change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the @DATE1 on a cold day in the mid @NUM1 he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke. There would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything.	2	2		2																						155	10	167	0	0	0	4.483870967741935	15.5	36	16	12	8	6	14	90	7.4	7.89	7.46	18	7.0	8.01	6.857142857142857	9.4	210

Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclist’s will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. The features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going	3	2		3																						178	8	198	13	0	0	4.550561797752809	22.25	37	34	9	15	8	22	102	11.1	8.77	7.67	22	9.6	10.94	11.6	10.7	246
4404	6801	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water begins to take a toll of how fast he can get to the next town. Another example would be the terrain only slows him down more.	1	1		1																						43	3	46	0	0	0	4.046511627906977	14.333333333333334	11	5	2	3	0	3	28	4.8	5.21	8.02	6	5.3	6.65	7.166666666666666	8.8	57
4406	6803	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it more difficult to ride. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” “a large highway sign jumped out atm.” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit.” “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The fact the it was such a hot day made the ride seem longer. When out of water you feel exostied. You will do just about anything to try to with stand the heat.	2	1		2																						90	5	96	1	0	0	4.366666666666666	18.0	22	17	6	5	0	16	43	14.2	7.9	7.93	11	10.3	12.44	15.333333333333334	6.4	111
4415	6812	3	The raugher the road gets for him the more determination he has at the beginning towards the end he had the mind set that, “it didn’t matter it was going to die, “this took a toll on him and it was hard to go on. He realyed he didn’t want to die that way and so he kept on, eventually leading to civilisation.	1	1		1																						63	3	68	3	0	0	3.9206349206349205	21.0	11	13	3	2	2	10	37	12.8	5.58	7.71	6	12.0	14.5	17.75	0.0	83
4417	6814	3	Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a group of old guys and ends up lost on rough road with no water, or relylittic supply of flat road was replaced by short rolling hills large highways lon jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” The rough road made have to work harder want more water and just made things tougher more than what they already were.	2	2		2																						99	4	107	2	0	0	4.343434343434343	24.75	28	17	11	5	3	9	44	15.5	7.9	9.1	14	12.6	14.41	17.5	8.8	125
4418	6815	3	The settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood. Take for instance the cycler. In the beginning he had a positive attitude but once he arrived at the first town his attitude started to go down from there. He explains describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” Ghost towns come across very old, run down and dull. That affected the cyclist because by it not being like the old men said he was becoming doubtful, which in turn doesn’t give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when he get to what is suppose to be water and a, “tar like substance oozed out.” That makes him nevers and mad because he isn’t sure he will make it. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store. The setting becomes positive and so does he. So, the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude.	2	2		2																						169	10	183	5	0	0	4.378698224852071	16.9	33	28	11	10	7	20	101	8.6	7.54	7.56	22	7.1	9.18	11.8	10.0	228
4423	6820	3	The cyclist of this story is greatly affected by the heat of his souroundings. While he riding to @CAPS1, the heat of the day began to increase. The text reads “ I had been hitting my water bootle regulary. “@CAPS2 to the heat of the day, the cyclist was down to his water consuming large patterns of it at a time.

4425	6822	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he’s fine. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn’t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, “It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” he knows that things are going to get rough, because “the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph”. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn’t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, “tumble weeds crossed my path.” The landscape seems to get more threatening too, “a ridiculously large shake.” The landscape changes with the state of water."	3	3		3																						206	13	238	14	0	0	4.334951456310679	15.846153846153847	44	37	15	14	7	37	118	9.3	6.85	7.88	20	7.8	9.6	10.4	7.9	259
4427	6824	3	the features of setting that the cyclist run into does affect him. For example when the setting changes from abandoned town to an empty deserted rond that no been on in thirty years; gives a cyclist less motivation him self to go on and even less strength.	1	1		1																						47	3	50	0	0	0	4.468085106382978	15.666666666666666	13	5	4	2	1	3	28	11.4	8.54	8.83	7	10.1	11.95	13.25	0.0	64
4432	6829	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much in this. The hot weather made him have a dry mouth leading to the lack of water. He used stones in his mouth and he said, “I’d read once that sucking of stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.""

4442	6839	3	The setting that affect the cyclist is the condition of the road because the road turns all different ways and the road goes up hill so it makes it harder to go up the road the cyclist has @NUM1 miles befor he gets to a town he could run out of water. If he run out of water befor he gets there, he might have to make stops so he doesn’t make hisself sick. When he gets to the town he can get more water.	1	1		1																						85	4	89	1	0	0	3.764705882352941	21.25	17	16	4	1	1	5	51	10.4	4.53	7.83	6	9.6	11.79	14.833333333333334	7.8	102
4446	6843	3	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist & his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,“and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place. Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert. that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced.	1	1		1																						127	6	147	13	0	0	4.708661417322834	21.166666666666668	28	11	17	4	3	22	71	13.5	9.46	7.77	19	10.8	11.67	11.4	10.8	174
4466	6863	3	How the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads, rolling hill, and the?? heat. The conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough. An example firm the texted is “ I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short ralling hills. These condition make is hard for the cycled it gives him a challenge.  The rolling hills challange him a regret to stay on the road it is easly tricky and challenges so was The heat & sun was also played an affection on the cyclist. An Examples from the @CAPS1 is.” I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat doing but I barely not ???. the sun was not starting to get him  ?? sharply ??  It will start to get ????? when is ?? is high deserts. I conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways but he keep pushing himself to more on.	3	2		3																						173	14	200	3	0	16	4.2272727272727275	12.571428571428571	40	27	9	8	6	21	94	9.9	7.37	8.64	27	7.9	9.8	8.166666666666666	8.8	224
4474	6871	3	The terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big affect on them. The first example of this is in they are riding on hills, it makes it much harder for them. For example when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to ride on hills he was, olcasly disappointed. Another thing that affects cyclist is the smothness of the road they are riding on. In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the main character came to rough spot in the road and was disappointed and didn’t want to ride it. Another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat. Several times in the story, the cyclists says that he is tired and dehydrated, at one point he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke. Those are the effects of the rider’s setting have on him/her.	2	2		2																						148	8	163	4	0	0	4.236486486486487	18.5	32	23	7	4	4	18	88	7.8	6.73	7.43	18	7.0	8.48	11.2	9.2	198
4477	6874	3	The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water. He did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him. Being in that situation and setting I would have given up.	2	2		2																						69	6	76	1	0	0	4.318840579710145	11.5	13	10	3	3	4	7	45	4.7	6.01	6.95	8	4.2	6.92	5.416666666666667	7.8	93
4485	6882	3	The @CAPS1 is affected in many ways. The major thing that effects him is the lack of water. Throughout the story he mentions the lack of water. He also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route. For example, “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off thire porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” The @CAPS1 says things about the older gentle man throughout the story.	2	2		2																						85	5	92	2	0	0	4.423529411764706	17.0	22	12	5	1	0	10	48	7.9	7.42	8.19	11	6.4	8.21	8.3	8.2	113
4486	6883	3	Setting very much affects the cyclist and now he feels. If he was in a bad setting then he would most likely be in a bad mood. Mood is highly affected by the general setting. In the essay “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist feels very confiedent of himself and the setting helps to boost that confiedence and andorence.	1	1		1																						64	4	69	0	0	0	4.453125	16.0	15	8	3	9	3	9	34	7.5	7.83	8.13	11	6.0	7.03	7.5	7.2	85
4487	6884	3	The features in the setting of the essay affected the author greatly. The Hills, on a hot day, with no water, or nearby town is really rough, expecially if you’ve been riding for more than @NUM1 miles. The environment of the hot June weather near a dessert area can cause serious problems, for example heat stroke and since he had no water to drink dehydration caused a lot of fear in the author. The setting of the essay and the conditions the author were under were extreamly dangerous and hes lucky he made it out alive.	2	2		2																						96	4	106	5	0	0	4.458333333333333	24.0	28	8	10	4	4	12	51	11.6	8.25	8.28	12	10.3	12.93	14.5	12.2	135
4489	6886	3	In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of, old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their parches since carter was in office, “and quickly realized that he shouldn’t have. The author describes the setting of the first “town” as, “the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This didn’t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and corral that couldn’t hold in the largest mule.” Was what met him there. The cyclist said that “this sight was troubling.” It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This short story shows how anything can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival.	2	2		2																						166	11	185	9	0	0	4.728915662650603	15.090909090909092	42	23	14	8	2	34	83	14.7	9.64	8.53	23	11.7	12.53	14.25	10.1	226
4498	6895	3	In the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy torns. Also, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people which made him fell alone and life he was going to die. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story “Over onelong, crippling hill a building came into view! This quote shows how the hills in the seting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						121	8	132	3	1	0	4.305785123966942	15.125	30	15	11	7	5	12	70	7.5	6.84	7.23	14	6.5	7.91	7.833333333333334	7.4	158
4504	6901	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he’s in the middle of nowhere with no water. The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” This quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car.	2	1		2																						100	7	105	0	0	0	4.39	14.285714285714286	24	16	5	7	0	11	55	15.9	8.19	8.29	10	13.9	14.52	18.333333333333332	10.5	137
4509	6907	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if they weren’t hills and rough roads, he would of been able to get to yosemite park faster and he wouldn’t of ran out of water.	1	1		1																						35	1	37	1	0	0	4.257142857142857	35.0	8	5	2	2	2	4	20	16.1	7.67	9.88	3	12.2	14.0	17.5	0.0	42
4511	6909	3	In my opinion the features of the selling affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he was talking abut the terair changing from long strat roads to shard winday one and the speed limit changing he said.he was doing a waterdepleting @NUM1 fuier sands like he is having a hard time, or doesn'twnt to go on.	1	1		1																						58	2	62	2	0	0	4.431034482758621	29.0	16	8	5	0	2	11	29	13.9	8.31	11.06	13	11.1	12.98	15.5	0.0	78
4512	6910	3	Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, “…The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him.	2	2		2																						145	5	160	5	0	0	4.657534246575342	29.2	38	19	8	4	4	16	76	15.2	9.93	8.23	20	12.2	13.81	15.5	13.0	208
4519	6917	3	In the essay “Rough road ahead: do not exeed posted speed limit,” the author is continually depressed, by the features of the landscape he passes. At first he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water, this sight doesn’t bothe him. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a “rusted water pump,” and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path then he passes an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. The setting its features serve to dissappoint depress the cyclist in his quest to find water.	3	2		3																						122	6	132	6	0	0	4.459016393442623	20.333333333333332	27	23	7	6	5	16	64	11.8	8.3	8.34	18	9.3	10.42	13.0	7.6	163
4523	6921	3	Poor directions heat, and lack of water affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is confident in the directions which would, “slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.”  As the story progresses, the cyclist is no longer so confident. The “heat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.” I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was near heat stroke. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him. His perseverance paid off. “Then , as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. The cyclist had found a barst shop and recteved water.	3	3		3																						176	9	197	13	0	0	4.553672316384181	19.666666666666668	53	17	10	10	5	31	89	14.8	9.18	8.78	26	12.3	14.42	20.333333333333332	12.5	251
4535	6933	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind. She didn’t knew where she was and on hip of that got lost. Whether you see nothing around. You or alot around you, you’re going to feel scared. They have the same affect. In the authors case, she was cycling and didn’t/couldn’t and water. This is an over whelming feeling because you can die from dehydration. She then kept cycling and saw nothing. “no one insight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” That is alatining no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die. These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They dffinately affected the cyclist because she was by herself, and on her dvun. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike and an empty water bottle.	3	2		3																						147	12	170	8	0	0	4.428571428571429	12.25	31	22	4	5	10	29	93	6.1	6.89	6.99	15	5.0	6.45	5.625	7.0	193
4542	6940	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road:Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit”by Joe kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way.It begins slowly with the “ghost town”.The narrorator “chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,” he wasn’t especially worried,but the fact he checked his water suggests that he’ll need to ration it for a while.The decline continues when he reaches the fock and the “ramshackle shed.”@CAPS1 the description of the place shows you he did not like it,and he confirms that with the words,“this sight was troubling.”He wouldn’t be replenishing his water here.Any more of this he’d be dead,either from dehydration or from pessimism.Eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea.This is ironics,he only going 12 mph to put it in his own words,“sometimes life can be so cruel.”He quite obviously hates the setting,and it’s all the fault of the setting.	3	2		3																						154	6	178	9	0	0	4.911949685534591	26.5	41	24	8	9	7	32	86	79.4	12.56	16.3	31	62.2	64.2	60.0	0.0	230
4545	6943	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist.	1	1		1																						99	6	107	2	0	0	4.373737373737374	16.5	24	10	9	3	1	8	61	7.4	7.31	7.33	14	7.4	8.22	8.083333333333334	8.3	135
4547	6945	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening. His water supply got drank quickly and he couldn’t find a town near. He was in the desert-like California, and the sun was beating down on him. When he did one town, it was more of a “ghost town”, and had rusted pumps that had battery-oil tasting liquid. Every person he asked told him is near, but from dehydration, it took him longer. the roads got windy and small hills occurred. There was a large snack in the middle of the road, as the tumble weed blew by. the finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down.	2	2		2																						119	8	137	6	0	0	4.260504201680672	14.875	30	21	9	4	7	18	63	8.5	6.67	7.8	13	7.5	9.26	8.333333333333334	9.3	154
4555	6953	3	The setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really goes against the cycilist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page @NUM1 it says, “a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn’t cool down,” This explains how bad the water was when the cycilist was there.	1	1		1																						75	4	81	4	0	0	4.306666666666667	18.75	21	10	3	4	5	14	41	11.4	7.38	7.82	8	9.5	10.53	13.5	8.8	98
4558	6956	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water.

4560	6958	3	In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it’s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It’s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn’t take the old mans advice.	3	2		3																						118	9	132	5	0	0	4.466101694915254	13.11111111111111	29	18	4	10	2	16	69	6.2	7.06	7.9	13	6.0	7.27	6.375	9.4	162
4562	6960	3	I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, “I could drop from heatstroke”. Meaning, its really hot! Also, l think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him because it says in the passage, “l eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. This has a big affect on him, because he’s very thirsty. Also, l think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars. I think all these things affect him.	2	2		2																						115	7	130	8	1	0	4.3652173913043475	16.428571428571427	21	23	4	8	0	18	67	5.5	6.31	6.74	12	4.7	6.16	5.875	7.4	150
4569	6967	3	"In the essay “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."	3	2		3																						170	13	188	5	0	0	4.6	13.076923076923077	38	27	16	8	5	23	97	7.3	8.11	7.68	23	6.5	7.33	10.8	8.8	234

This means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused.

4586	6984	3	The setting affect of a cyclist can be petty complicated. So many things has to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up have to be prepared for the weather. For example when there is serious weather conditions like rain,snow you have to careful of ley roads.Also they have to be prepared for is long riais. Some naes might be from @NUM1 miles the have to bring plenty of food and water. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike. For instance he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going cooperate. Also if work need's to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on.Also another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist is in shape. For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint.	1	1		1																						184	13	210	1	0	0	4.188172043010753	14.307692307692308	44	26	13	10	2	17	121	6.9	6.38	6.95	17	7.4	8.42	7.142857142857142	9.8	253
4587	6985	3	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.	1	1		1																						71	4	75	0	0	0	4.394366197183099	17.75	20	10	3	2	1	8	40	8.1	7.6	7.19	9	6.7	7.12	7.875	3.1	94
4595	6993	3	The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was riding through the deserts in June. The cyclist barely had water at the end of the stony. A lot of buidings were abandoned, right when he needed water.

4602	7000	3	To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was given very old directions. He was given back roads that are abandoned now. These towns had no people in them normally that would not matter, but he “was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” (@NUM1). If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A “ghost town” with no good water could have killed him. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them.	2	2		2																						105	7	120	6	0	0	4.561904761904762	15.0	24	16	6	3	6	18	60	7.5	7.59	7.69	13	5.6	8.67	7.142857142857142	8.8	138
4604	7002	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist runs into a couple obstacles and they affected him in many ways. In the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles. “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state.” This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had tumbleweed, a snake and he was dehydrated. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration. All through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well.	2	2		2																						112	7	121	2	0	0	4.517857142857143	16.0	28	16	4	6	5	13	65	11.1	8.54	8.41	17	9.7	12.17	12.0	11.6	157
4622	7020	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”, California’s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exguasted and dehydrated.	2	3		3																						207	8	227	12	0	0	4.478260869565218	25.875	50	27	13	13	10	23	121	12.6	8.42	6.9	19	11.0	11.52	15.5	11.7	290
4632	7030	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. “... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist.	1	1		1																						75	5	82	1	0	0	4.653333333333333	15.0	20	8	7	1	1	9	42	8.0	8.34	7.75	12	6.8	6.53	7.1	7.6	102
4636	7034	3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .” The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,” In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.	3	2		3																						163	9	178	8	0	0	4.7607361963190185	18.11111111111111	45	23	11	9	5	20	84	12.6	9.99	9.05	28	10.0	12.02	14.5	10.9	225
4637	7035	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First the climate affected him the most thats so because he became to hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated. So he had no energy because of dehydration. Another one is the built of the road. That’s so because it was rocky bumpy, winding, hills with being dehydrated the road was very tempting to just give up and die. Then the heat got him because there was no shade, no water left, and the sun just beating down on him.	2	2		2																						92	6	105	6	0	0	4.336956521739131	15.333333333333334	18	15	5	9	3	13	61	6.7	6.55	6.8	9	5.7	7.86	7.833333333333334	9.3	124

4641	7039	3	The main features that affected the cyclist were the ruff terrain and the hot sun. The rough terrain made it harder to pedal and it tired the cyclist out faster. But also helping was the hot sun because it would dehydrate him while he was riding. So between the hard to pedal rough terrain and the dehydratiog hot sun, the cyclist was very affect to the point of exausition.	1	1		1																						69	4	74	1	0	0	4.434782608695652	17.25	15	8	8	4	4	6	38	8.1	7.71	7.7	11	7.7	9.24	8.625	8.8	95
4645	7043	3	The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many way. It was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty. For example, “The sun was beginning to heat down” (pg @NUM1). So the sun is very exhusting and made him to start dehydrating. Another example is a traveling through the desert of California in June” (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state and June is one of it’s warmer months. The terrain didn’t favor in the riders either “Flat road had turned into, short rolling hills “(pg @NUM2). Short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain. This is how the setting affected the rider.	2	2		2																						113	9	129	2	0	0	4.486725663716814	12.555555555555555	36	10	12	4	3	19	54	6.0	6.83	7.48	11	5.8	7.52	6.625	9.7	156
4646	7044	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert.

4651	7049	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worse problems and couldnt really do anything about them. also, he started out fine, then he started to become dehydrated. He didnt have much water left and he was only @NUM1 miles up the road. a loss of water was very affective in June traveling through a desert. also, the damage of the road was very affective too because hes on a bike and not too good of balance. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, temperature, loss of water, road damages and snakes. the cyclist was on a bike and couldnt really protect himself, and he was dehydrated, and tired.	2	1		2																						122	8	143	9	1	0	4.590163934426229	15.25	28	14	8	12	7	17	76	15.4	9.06	8.0	16	14.0	14.5	14.75	12.6	177

4661	7059	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in “high desert of California in June.” This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																						120	10	133	3	0	0	4.383333333333334	12.0	25	20	9	9	4	14	76	5.2	6.6	6.99	17	4.4	6.13	5.333333333333333	8.2	161
4670	7068	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died.	2	1		2																						83	7	91	1	0	0	4.180722891566265	11.857142857142858	17	13	4	3	4	8	54	4.2	5.5	5.75	5	4.4	5.72	5.357142857142857	6.9	107
4672	7070	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.	1	1		1																						85	5	90	0	0	0	4.176470588235294	17.0	17	9	2	6	2	5	57	6.8	6.32	6.34	8	6.4	9.15	8.9	9.9	111
4675	7073	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, “by Joe Kurmaskie had many obsticales to over come. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, “@CAPS1 my gosh, what did I get myself into?!” Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in.	2	2		2																						143	6	156	7	1	1	4.363636363636363	23.833333333333332	34	23	8	6	4	19	80	11.0	7.67	7.91	22	10.2	11.48	13.75	10.1	200

This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert.

4684	7082	3	The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was “going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch’s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy.

He said, “what I shouldn’t have done was to let them see my map"".  Another problem he faced was when he began to run out of water.  This caused a problem to him because of dehydration. In the story he said, “The water bottle contained any a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1, another problem he encountered was the desert area that he was riding through. This caused problem for him because there wasn’t anybody around to help him if he needed it.

4698	7096	3	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since carter was in office.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers “shortcut” and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible.	2	2		2																						139	9	155	4	1	0	4.719424460431655	15.444444444444445	41	22	8	5	5	23	66	9.5	8.99	8.48	23	7.7	9.26	7.571428571428571	9.8	199

4703	7101	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how everychange happened. For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldn’t feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.	1	1		1																						63	4	67	0	0	0	4.444444444444445	15.75	12	8	6	6	3	5	36	7.4	7.83	6.68	5	7.1	6.95	8.375	10.1	88
4705	7103	3	Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesn’t have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would’ve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, don’t use a bike in the desert, its not to smart.	1	2		2																						147	9	167	10	0	0	3.9183673469387754	16.333333333333332	29	21	10	11	7	24	100	5.2	4.35	6.38	8	4.9	7.34	7.0	7.8	176
4706	7104	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because when all the cyclist is worried about is finding a place with water all he’s doing is getting scared and panicing. In other words, when he’s looking around, the setting he sees is like desert and no buildings. The story says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” when he sees that he panics and thinks he’s not gonna make it which affects him mentally.	1	1		1																						78	3	85	3	0	0	4.602564102564102	26.0	15	15	4	4	3	9	42	13.2	9.29	9.18	13	9.9	11.94	14.0	8.8	104
4711	7109	3	Features of any setting affect what you do and how you do it. Features affect the cyclist by water, help, and saftey. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing what spit you have to circulate.” This quote so his desperate need for water by saying he sucks a on rock to drink his own spit. The rough terrain and abandoned road the old men sent him on that was out of date, made him unable to ask for directions, and to even know if he is travelling correctly. Along the road he meets a snake. Being so far away from civilization, if he was to have gotten bit then he would have no one to help save him from dyeing on the side of the road. Also, if he was to have a heatstroke he has no water and no help. Safty, help, and water are all factors which contribute to the features, and how they effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						167	9	184	9	0	0	4.095808383233533	18.555555555555557	37	29	6	9	7	18	102	9.8	6.16	7.56	21	7.9	11.48	14.0	9.2	208
4713	7111	3	The cyclist’s features around him affected him negatively. He was cycling through “the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His water bottle was slowly running outand the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like batteryacid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states “Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.	3	3		3																						142	9	161	3	0	0	5.076923076923077	15.88888888888889	39	24	10	11	4	21	65	10.5	11.13	7.76	19	8.3	8.86	7.571428571428571	10.5	215

4749	7147	3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water “to feel sorry for himself” The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to “rolling hills”. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist.	3	2		3																						171	12	187	6	0	0	4.8011695906432745	14.25	44	30	15	11	2	23	83	8.4	9.5	8.33	30	7.6	8.5	6.375	9.7	249

These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldn’t get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake.” They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted “I eased past.” When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist’s journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other “GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, we’re your BEST BET.""The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect.

4757	7155	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who haden’t gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldn’t get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip.	2	3		3																						145	8	154	1	0	0	4.23448275862069	18.125	31	18	11	10	1	12	85	7.6	6.55	6.82	12	6.8	9.17	8.166666666666666	8.8	182

This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant” which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation.	2	2		2																						105	5	114	4	0	0	4.59047619047619	21.0	26	11	5	11	7	13	69	10.7	8.82	7.23	10	7.9	9.16	10.4	7.6	134

8886	14836	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was that the dirigible would have to be held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the building's frame in order to make the frame or sturdy, there was modifications to the building's framework which cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was the dirigible's use of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Since New York was a densely populated area, this would not work out well. The dirigibles would also have to be weighted down in the back with lead weights. In order to do so, the lead weights would end up dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was a safety issue one last obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area.	3	4		4																						166	8	180	3	0	0	4.656626506024097	20.75	46	22	8	10	2	12	96	12.4	9.52	8.14	28	10.2	12.13	12.4	11.5	232

After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were displayed by the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"". The result of the expirament were that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass.

Following that they told @LOCATION1 how Hindenburg by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there.	3	3		3																						114	9	123	0	0	0	4.842105263157895	12.666666666666666	30	18	11	2	1	12	56	7.7	9.38	8.7	19	5.9	8.24	7.0	10.3	158
8894	14844	6	The Empire State Building's docking zone was a magnificent and novel idea when it was first concieved but it was too difficult to implement. Al Smith, who spearheaded the operation, was too over anxious to complete it. Since not enough time was devoted to researching the risk's and structure of the dock, the plan to mount it on top the Empire State Building was already a failure.       Before the construction even began, trouble started to brew. The building couldn't withstand the stress of the @DATE1 foot long dirigible. The shock to the building would have transmitted tremendous pressure to the foundation. So the roof would have to be re-done in order for it to be structurally sound. After many months and @NUM1 dollars, the creation of the landing dock could begin.       Life is precious, and the landing dock was too volatile and dangerous to be used. The architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen not helium. Hydrogen is extremely Flammable. In @LOCATION1, the Hindenburg, which was constructed using hydrogen caught aflame and killed hundreds. There was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area. The idea was ostentatious and showy but because it was rushed, precautions were not taken into account. The obstacles that faced the docking station were too much, so finally the plan to erect it was abandoned.	3	3		3																						233	15	265	10	0	0	4.957446808510638	15.666666666666666	59	33	20	17	9	30	133	10.8	10.32	9.06	48	9.1	11.11	9.0	11.4	348

An obstacle as well that came with these dirigibles was all the time and effort they had to put in to learn how to safely install a mooring mast.

The mask made to made nature a danger to the whole building because of violent air current. Another reason how the Empire State Building failed is because their was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas.

In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: @CAPS1 building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the @LOCATION1. If the highly flamable helium inside the dirigibles then it would be putting thousands of peoples lives in jeopardy. Finally the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp.

The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation.	3	3		3																						141	7	153	0	0	0	4.9787234042553195	20.142857142857142	38	20	12	4	0	10	81	12.1	11.08	8.66	27	9.9	11.73	10.5	12.3	210

This job was not an easy thing to accomplish, it's not as simple as it might sound. If the builders added a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame.

There was also a law against airships driving too low and this would enable them from being able to dock. Also since other dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, it could easily cause a fire.

The Mooring @CAPS1 project came to a hault in the late 1930s, in order to keep the people of downtown New York City safe.	3	3		3																						150	8	162	4	0	0	4.886666666666667	18.75	50	17	15	6	1	14	71	11.0	10.5	8.78	29	9.4	11.25	13.2	12.2	225

On the expert it states, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."". If anyone disobayed this law it may result in punishment; as a result, it would create a new obstacle the builders would have to deal with.Last but not least, the idea of docking airships to a building is extremely unsafe.

If a disaster ever took place, many lifes would have been lost or severely injuried.

There were many things that could go wrong such as, the blimp hitting a spire and killing all the people below.The Greatest obstacle was nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast it would get wraped around the building, or just getting to the mooring would be difficult because of the wind.Overall the mooring mast was not a practical Idea.

Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.

Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking.

9224	15174	6	The Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles serverely affected the building attemp of the dirigible dock. For instance, The Empire State building is located in a very dense urban location. At the time most dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen insted of Helium. The main difference between the two was that Hydrogen is more flamable then Helium. So if the Hydrogen from the dirigible was to ignit then a castistrophic fire would arise. The effects could be as devistating as the Hindenburg which ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The result of the Hindenburg accident forced the architectures and enginners to look for a safer, alternate solution. Explosive gases were not the only problem though. Strong, gustful winds were present at the top of the Empire State Building. If winds were to blow a docking dirigible offcourse then the outcome would be deadly. If the dirigibles caught fire or were blown offcourse will docking then the pedistrians on the ground level could be injured.	2	3		3																						177	12	194	5	0	0	5.090395480225989	14.75	54	19	17	10	2	23	88	9.9	11.07	8.65	39	9.1	10.44	9.0	12.5	281
9226	15176	6	There were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that the dirigible hanging by one cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. This stress would cause the buildings foundation to crack. This obstacle caused the architects to have to strengthen the foundation, this cost them over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another obstacle was they had to make another floor which would be used for passengers and would let elevators bring the passengers to the eighty-sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be located. These observation areas were to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once this was done, they then had complete the roof before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Another obstacle was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were always shifting and the dirigibles, that usually land in open fields, could be weighted down with lead weights, but could not be used at the Empire State Building, where they would be hanging over pedestrians on the streets. Another obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for dirigible to tie up or even approach the Empire State Building. All these many obstacles led to the ideas of dirigibles and mooring mast, for the dirigibles had dissapeared.	3	4		4																						236	11	259	10	0	0	4.987288135593221	21.454545454545453	64	33	11	7	6	21	138	12.8	11.08	7.71	37	10.5	11.31	13.2	12.9	351

One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The greater obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The dirigible couldn't do anything even if tethered it to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.	2	2		2																						99	4	106	2	0	0	4.6767676767676765	24.75	32	10	6	3	1	7	55	13.0	9.75	9.17	19	10.6	13.15	14.875	12.2	140
9229	15179	6	The installation of a mooring mass on top of the Empire State building would have made the building, as well as the city of New York, incredibly important to modern travel in the 1930s. Alas, many difficult obstacles made the mast impossible to complete. First, to get the mast to the top, the buildings frame had to be strengthened and reinforced, which was painstaking and expensive. Second, the builders had to deal with the possibility of the blimps exploding. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. With constantly shifting, violent winds at the top of the building, the zeppelin would sway and swivel around the mast, making it difficult and dangerous to unload passengers. With high winds, the zeppelin could even detach from its mooring and fall onto the city below, potentially killing hundreds. Lastly, the builders failed to take into account the law that forbade dirigibles to fly too close to urban areas. This law made it illegal for any blimp to get near the Empire State Building, let alone dock on it. The thought of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a fantastic idea, albeit one destined to fail from the beginning.	4	4		4																						197	10	222	15	0	0	4.873096446700508	19.7	54	28	16	12	5	23	103	11.4	10.27	8.62	38	8.6	11.13	10.666666666666666	11.6	285

9241	15191	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a density populated area and you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast the reality. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building. Therefore, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed.	3	3		3																						163	5	175	6	0	0	4.865030674846626	32.6	42	17	13	8	6	9	96	17.8	11.09	8.26	23	14.8	16.72	21.666666666666668	15.9	251
9242	15192	6	The dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building for obvious reasons. When the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was having a dirigible landing on the top of the building. There were a few cautions that the workers realized. First off, if the dirigible catches on fire like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot of people would be at risk because it is such a big city with massive amounts of people. Another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds. If they tried landing there, but the violent winds wouldn't let them, then it would not be the least bit safe. This is how the workers of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.	2	2		2																						150	7	165	6	0	0	4.546666666666667	21.428571428571427	38	13	14	9	1	13	91	10.7	8.53	7.12	18	9.3	10.96	12.2	11.8	212

In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not adressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location.

For example the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top it. Also the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable so an accident above an urban area thats highly popuated would have been costly/fatal. Another obstacle was the wind, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building unpractical and unsafe.	3	3		3																						106	4	115	2	0	0	5.10377358490566	26.5	29	11	11	6	2	7	57	15.8	12.25	9.87	25	13.6	15.51	17.0	15.6	173

As with any vehicle in the air or at sea, wind is either your enemy, or your friend. The engineers should have taken into greater consideration that changing wind speeds and direction 1,250 feet in the air are huge threats. Your dirigible will have a hard time getting close enough to the mast to moor, never mind to stay steady enough for passengers to exit, and board safely. Also if the law itsself prevented you from floating your blimp at such low altitudes, then its game over. Why even bother if its illegal? Although it seems like a futuristic sci-fi, and not to mention downright cool way to land a blimp, to many things prevented the idea from prevailing.	2	2		2																						141	7	158	9	0	1	4.773049645390071	20.142857142857142	36	19	13	9	7	17	72	11.1	9.69	8.66	23	8.8	11.73	12.4	12.0	202

As in the article, the ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was unsafe for both passengers of the dirigible and pedestrians below to be close to the blimp and the turbulent air. Also, the flammability of the hydrogen in the blimp caused a problem; it was very unsafe to have a possible fire hazard that was @NUM1 feet long, floating close over a very populated place such as New York City. In addition to that, laws that airships could not fly too close over urban areas prohibited dirigibles even coming close to the mooring mast over the Empire State Building. A test run with the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles proved that it was too dangerous and impractical; the dirigible could not even get close enough to tie up.

From the very beginning of it's construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped the record for the highest building.	3	3		3																						178	9	201	10	0	0	5.00561797752809	19.77777777777778	58	22	9	10	5	20	93	12.1	10.97	8.79	34	9.8	11.52	13.2	12.7	265

At that time, it was the law that you couldn't fly an airship that low over urban areas. When tested, some blimps couldnt get close enough because of the heavy winds.

If they were to succeed, they would have become a major aviation accommidation for transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be constructed and put on to the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task. The Empire State Building's frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framework. Once the framework was adjusted, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from the inside. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed. Once the roof was constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own skeleton of steel. Once the entire project was finished, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous. After all the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose.	2	2		2																						231	12	254	7	0	0	4.93073593073593	19.25	63	37	13	9	3	19	128	11.4	10.79	8.01	39	9.6	10.84	12.0	11.2	342

Is because it would have added to much stress to the frame of the Empire State Building, which could have caused the collapse over a period of time. So the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be ""modified and strengthened to accomade this new situation"", as said in the excerpt. After the builders completed framing the Empire State Building up to the eighty-fifth floor, it was now time to do the framing of the rooftop to create an area where the mooring mast would be placed. After the workers completed the framing of the rooftop, they build the mooring mast on to it, now the builders faced the challenge of framing the mooring mass. The builders framed the mooring mast with a skeleton of steel. The builders faced these challenges in the attempt to allow derilibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	2	1		2																						183	7	199	5	0	0	4.628415300546448	26.142857142857142	59	25	3	4	1	15	99	13.4	9.41	7.69	22	9.9	12.41	14.5	10.0	243

9532	15482	6	In the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First there was the obvious concern, safety, a dirigible dangling over New York City does not seem very safe. And it @CAPS1 wasn't a reasonable thing to build, the empire state building was already tall enough, why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway.	1	1		1																						75	3	84	4	0	0	4.906666666666666	25.0	23	11	7	7	1	10	38	14.2	10.68	9.09	18	11.9	15.33	15.833333333333334	13.6	113

""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind Pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". In order to make it work they would use diffrent Steel. Another obstacle the builder @ORGANIZATION1 would be safety. Winds and hydrogen were main focuses.

9542	15492	6	There were a handful of problems that came along with the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building.  This idea was hardly practical, for safety reasons mostly.  If a dirigible docked there on one cable, extreme tension would be put on the building.  Also, if an international dirigible were to dock filled with very flammable hydrogen and catch fire, the results would be catostrophic.The task of actually docking would be a problem as well.  With such a high altitude, winds were very strong.  Nothing could prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building.  In other situations, dirigibles would be weighted down with lead weights.  However, if these were to fall, they would land in the busy city streets of New York.  Lastly, there was a law against low flying air ships, completely dismissing the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																						145	10	174	10	0	0	4.785714285714286	15.4	40	17	11	12	1	18	78	74.8	12.27	14.42	25	58.7	60.76	7.857142857142858	0.0	223

According to paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This problem required over sixty thousand dollares' worth of modifications to the buildings framework. Although structural issues were a problem, the safety of the pidestrians created a even bigger obstacle for the builders.Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium which created huge fire hazzards ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM2).

9556	15506	6	The were many obstacle's the builder's of the Empire State Building had to face in attempt to allow the docking of dirigible's. There was no way architects could drop a mooring mast on top of the building's smooth roof. If a thousand foot dirigible overshadowed the top of the building with only one cable tether, stress the building's frame would be added instantly. Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Another obstacle for the builder's was that the building's steel frame would have to be strengthened to accommodate with this new design. The greatest obstacle in launching this new design was nature. Architects would needed to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be unsturdy. The fact that this design would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street, would worry the architects concern of the population. Architects also had to deal with the law against airships traveling too low above urban areas. This law would state the forbidden right of one to tether a large ship to a bulding, or even approach the area. Although there were attempts of dirigible's to reach a bulding, the entire idea was dropped, much to the architects despite.	3	3		3																						229	12	257	6	0	0	4.890829694323144	19.083333333333332	70	28	13	9	2	19	133	11.1	10.39	8.17	45	8.4	10.61	12.2	11.5	331
9569	15519	6	"During the attemp in building a docking station for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles that made this idea less and less possible. One huge problem was due to the building's foundation. A swinging blimp, which can be up to a thousand feet in length, on top of the building would add a huge amount of stress. This meant extra money would need to be dumped into the strengthening of the foundation and framework, in order to support a huge zeppelin on the mooring mast. Since the building tops out at 1,250 feet in altitude, fierce air currents rip through the top of the building. This caused impossible docking conditions because the blimp could hit the building and pop. Due to the flammability of hydrogen this dangerous eruption could wreck havoc on the densely populated city below. Refering to the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated area.""

Another obstacle was the laws in place that prevented derigibles from flying too low over urban areas. So no dirigibles could have legally docked at the mast anyway. A final obstacle was nature.

Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that it would have been unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable would put people not only inside of the dirigibles, but everyone near and around it, in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there.

9623	15573	6	When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of cilvians. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were many obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful.	3	3		3																						175	9	199	12	0	0	5.005714285714285	19.444444444444443	47	22	14	10	4	21	95	11.9	10.97	7.58	25	9.7	10.5	10.166666666666666	11.2	254

9652	15602	6	Building docks for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was a real challenge for Al Smith. The Steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would put too much stress on the building's frame. The dirigibles were highly flammable and that put a huge risk in safety for the workers in the building and the people on the street. The dirigible's movements could not be monitored due to violent air currents at the top of the building. The main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work was because of the law against airships. The law did not allow airships fly low over urban areas.

The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas.	3	3		3																						104	5	112	0	0	0	5.390476190476191	21.0	26	11	10	10	1	5	61	15.0	11.49	9.33	23	18.2	14.63	12.8	13.8	203

9661	15611	6	The builders that constructed The Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly they could not just simply drop a mooring mast atop the building and hope for the best. The mast would add a large amount of stress to the framework, also factor in the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure, and the framework would need to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a key problem the builders ran into. Most dirigibles were highly flammable, and to have them fly over such a populated city as New York would be impractical. As well as their flammable characteristic there was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So therefore it was illegal to tie up, or even approach the building. The last obstacle the builders ran into was the wind. The winds at that height were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. There was also the fear that the wind would blow the ships into the sharp spires of another building. Including the obstacles and the loss of interest in dirigibles was the result in the discontinuation of the project.	3	4		4																						197	11	212	4	0	0	4.776649746192893	17.90909090909091	51	22	14	18	7	14	111	10.0	9.68	8.05	34	7.9	10.41	11.8	11.0	283

The steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the dirigible to be docked onto it. This modification and strengthening of the building process would call for an investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Next, the safety issue arose after being neglected before the building process began. Most dirigibles there were used outside of the United States contained hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, as opposed to using helium. This was a serious problem for a German dirigible named Hindenburg, when it was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. @ORGANIZATION2 writes ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1).

The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting and no lead weights could be placed on the dirigible to stop it from shifting because it was a serious threat to pedestrians below.

For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground.	2	2		2																						154	5	167	6	0	0	4.577922077922078	30.8	38	23	5	6	4	10	93	15.5	9.35	8.24	23	12.9	14.92	14.25	12.0	213

Most dirigibles were fueled by hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This danger was shown by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, and the owners of the building did not want to face a similar accident in a place as densely populated as New York. Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. This would not only be a technical hassle as it would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible, and make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship as well. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Because of this, docking a ship there would be illegal which obviously way not helpful to the project. In the end, these obstacles were the key reasons that the endeavor failed.	4	4		4																						219	10	236	7	0	0	4.648401826484018	21.9	51	22	18	17	4	17	127	11.4	9.23	8.54	41	10.7	12.96	12.8	13.0	320

""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (¶ @NUM1) They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's fram. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as Lüsted points out in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, as one can see, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigables to dock there."	3	3		3																						222	12	253	9	0	0	4.95045045045045	18.5	69	27	14	9	0	24	124	14.2	10.86	8.56	38	10.6	12.4	19.666666666666668	12.3	316
9769	15719	6	In the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, she describes the difficulties of designing the Mast for Dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. Al Smith the mayor of New York City at the time of construction of the Empire State building came up with the idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York city a technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed desingners discovered problems with mast being installed. They discovered that they would have to modify the steel frame because if a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would transimite stress all the way down the frame to the foundation. due to the load and wind pressure. The wind speeds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible around in the wind, this is very unsafe being close to a building.	2	2		2																						154	7	163	2	0	0	4.558441558441558	22.0	53	16	6	4	1	11	83	12.9	9.0	7.99	24	11.0	12.88	11.8	11.2	213

9781	15731	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles docked there. Based on excerpt, one of these obstacles were the lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. If they got close enough to tie up, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers because of the fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell. Also, for the dirigible to be added, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework.	2	3		3																						177	8	191	6	0	0	4.638418079096045	22.125	49	21	14	10	2	14	98	11.5	9.11	8.57	27	9.5	10.87	10.166666666666666	11.0	246

Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over your ring areas.

Though the idea was good, it provided the builders with many obstacles. For example, when the framework was being built, the mast was going to have to be added to the top. The mast couldn't just be dropped on, however because if a dirigibles were to the moored there, it would put too much stress on the building's framework. This revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger which was very expensive.Another difficulty the builder's faced, after construction was completed, in allowing dirigibles to dock there was nature.

9884	15834	6	Architects of the Empire State Building faced a tremendous amount of obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the man who wanted to construct the tallest building, stated on December 11, 1929, that the Empire State would be 1,250 feet tall. It was decided that the building would have a mooring mast at the top for docking airships like the dirigibles. The blimps, however, was very spacey. Some were as long as one thousand feet in length. So a mooring mast sounds fitting. It would allow dirigibles/blimps to anchor there to refuel as well as letting the passengers off and on.Presently, the purpose of the mooring mast was never carried out. Problems that faced it was that most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the German dirigible Hindenburg incident caused the Empire S Building's owners to realize how bad it would be if it happened above such a densely populated area like New York. The winds on top of the building is always changing. A dirigible tethered to the mooring mast would have the back of the ship swivel around and around. Weights couldn't be added to weigh down the back because the blimp would be right above people walking on the streets. Another practical reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for the blimp to even approach the building.On December 1930, U.S. Navy dirigible reached the mooring mast. However, it could not get close enough to tie the blimp in place due to forceful winds. The captain couldn't even take his hands off the controls in fear. In the late 1930's, the idea disappeared to be replaced by airplanes.	4	3		4																						295	19	332	11	0	0	4.777777777777778	15.631578947368421	84	36	18	23	3	31	161	9.4	9.57	8.46	49	7.3	8.87	7.571428571428571	10.4	420

The Chrysler building was originally only @NUM1 feet and the Empire State building was planned to be @NUM2 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had begun.When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph @NUM3), he wanted something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of @ORGANIZATION3 below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, @NUM4 feet taller then the Chrysler Building.The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that the building seems to face was the elements.

So there were many obstacles when building a docking area for drigibles on the Empire State building.One obstacle was the wind. People cannot control the wind or anything in the wind. So when it was really windy the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth. When the Navy tried to tie up the dirigibles they couldn't get it close to the mooring mast because the winds were strong. That's one obstacle of building docking areas.Another obstacle is safety. The dirigibles used gas instead of helium, so it was very flammable. Also they don't have a lot of control over them. If the dirigible ever came crashing down it would kill a lot of pedestrians.If the Navy could fix these obstacles then the dirigible would be a good idea. They are hard to fix but probably possible. The better idea though is to just get rid of them.	2	3		3																						169	15	194	1	0	0	4.482558139534884	11.466666666666667	40	19	12	13	4	15	111	7.1	7.88	6.11	16	6.4	7.77	7.7142857142857135	10.3	235

In order for the mooring mast to successfully hold a dirigible, over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the framework of the building. Still @CAPS1 got in the way, the greatest being safety. Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen gas rather than helium, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State building realized how bad a dirigible fire would be, and more so if it took place over the densely populated city of New York. Wind also was a serious factor that disassembled the idea. If the dirigible were to be tied to the mast, the back of the ship which swing around, and lead weights were out of the question. Blocks of lead hanging above pedestrians in the streets of New York was neither a practical nor safe idea. An additional obstacle was the existing law that would not allowed airships to fly low, or too close to urban areas. Even if it was attempted, ships would have a hard time docking because of forceful winds. These @CAPS1 were all stumbled across in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, an idea that is no longer considered.	4	4		4																						221	11	242	10	0	0	4.6877828054298645	20.09090909090909	61	26	17	14	6	23	119	10.7	9.23	8.21	40	9.9	12.02	12.8	12.1	326

One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles."	3	3		3																						178	9	196	8	0	0	4.842696629213483	19.77777777777778	40	21	23	13	4	19	97	11.3	10.21	8.97	37	9.8	11.96	8.142857142857142	12.1	261

A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building.

10002	15952	6	In, The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. This means the still frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable.Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.	4	3		4																						187	11	210	7	0	0	4.824468085106383	17.09090909090909	58	20	12	8	3	18	109	10.8	10.15	7.94	33	8.2	10.26	10.5	10.8	264
10005	15955	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. The thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The second problem was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The third problem was the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. It was over sixty thousand dollars worth to make the buildings framework. But unfortunately all the problems were unsolved and the height made it desirable to postpon to a later date but instead of becoming the transportation of the future, they had been given away to airplanes.	3	2		3																						158	7	173	2	0	0	4.905063291139241	22.571428571428573	48	20	10	5	5	12	90	13.0	10.97	8.26	31	10.9	12.58	11.8	11.8	230

The Goodyear blimp called the ""Columbia"" attempted to reach the mooring mast although they had a skillful pilot he could not get the Steel framed balloon close enough to dock on the Spire. Another factor the architects did not weigh in to the equation was that most diridibles were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable. If a zeppelin did catch on Fire then that would be on massive ball of fire coming down on the streets of downtown New York.

10020	15970	6	The builders of the Empire state building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, after Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there.	3	4		4																						167	8	184	9	0	0	4.838323353293413	20.875	40	20	16	11	1	16	89	11.8	10.21	8.64	36	10.3	11.95	11.333333333333334	13.0	257

To combat this, @MONEY1 of modifications had to made to the building's framework. Unfortunately, most of the complications of the mooring mast were not considered until after it was built. A most important one was safety, in that that many foreign dirigibles to use helium to float which is highly flammable. A disaster like the Hindenburg disaster over New York City is too dangerous to risk. Another preventer of the mast were the winds at the top of the building that were constantly changing due to the violent air currents. The swaying dirigible could not be secured with hanging weights due to the danger of dropping one over a very populated New York City. A huge complication of making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a docking to ever take place. The many obstacles that face the builders of the Empire State building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, eventually led to the dropping of the idea all together.	4	4		4																						220	11	238	5	0	0	4.931818181818182	20.0	61	30	16	14	1	17	118	11.8	10.85	8.5	46	9.9	12.18	11.0	13.0	340

Most of the blimps from outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen other than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. And they did not want to risk anyone getting hurt in a densely populated area. Also, another big obstacle was @CAPS1 nature itself. At times the winds would be violent and it would go back and forth. And if a blimp was attached, it would be dangling violently over citizens had not nearly safe. Lastly, it was illegal to have airships flying close to urban areas and New York was highly dense. And the reason for this law is for nothing bad to happen to the citizens. In conclusion, there were many obstacles the builders had gone through, and they were blinded by the project and they wanted to get it done they forgot about safety."	3	4		4																						205	11	229	10	0	0	4.655339805825243	18.727272727272727	48	23	15	14	9	25	123	10.9	9.11	8.04	30	8.9	10.93	15.0	11.2	292

They would need to find a way to dock the dirigibles to the mast with out having it swing in the wind. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM1). Another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building was designing the mast. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM2). The Empire State Building's steel frame had to be strengthened in order to withstand to weight of the mast."	2	2		3																						125	7	144	2	0	0	4.808	17.857142857142858	43	20	3	4	1	12	64	13.7	9.93	7.4	15	10.7	11.92	15.5	12.0	176

The excerpt states ""The steel frame of the empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened"". This shows that in order for the mast to even be built the structure of the entire building would need to be altered to accomidate the use of the mast. The second obstacle they faced, in the actual use of the mast, was nature. In hopes of docking the dirigibles to the mast, mother nature would not allow it, as it @CAPS1 in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" They also warned that with those air currents the passengers would not make it off of th dirigible safely due to the end of the dirigible floating rapidly undocked. They feared that if they docked the end it would be unsafe to the pedestrians below just as the helium in the dirigible would of as well."	3	3		3																						179	8	196	5	0	0	4.5083798882681565	22.375	45	19	12	10	1	15	105	11.0	8.59	8.1	29	9.7	11.87	8.666666666666666	11.2	249
10132	16082	6	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, explains how the spire of the Empire State Building was originally meant to be used as a mooring mast. This purpose of the spire was never to be fulfilled because of the numerous problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the biggest problems that the builders faced were unpredictable and violent winds, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, and air laws. The winds posed to be a problem because even though the front of the dirigible would be tethered to the mast belonged back side would be allowed to swing freely in the wind which could cause it to crash into another moored dirigible. The winds also would make just getting to the Empire a hazardous job. The use of hydrogen was a problem because hydrogen is a volatile gas in the sense that it explodes, which would be very dangerous over a densely populated area. Lastly, the air laws were a problem because the United States has a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make a mooring at the Empire State Building illegal."	4	3		4																						208	7	226	9	0	0	4.6875	29.714285714285715	59	24	13	11	3	17	115	15.5	9.99	8.53	35	12.5	14.0	14.75	12.0	294
10135	16085	6	"Without a doubt, the builders of the mooring mast that was to rest at the top of the Empire State Building were highly innovative and ambitious. However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties that they both overcame and were overcome by. One major difficulty that they faced was that a one thousand foot long dirigible being tethered to a 1,250 foot tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a great deal of stress onto the building, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" @CAPS1, the builders were over to overcome this problem. After the building however, the mooring mast was not able to be used for it's full purpose because of more challenges that it faced. After the tragic accident with the Hindenburg, ""the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a density populated area such as downtown New York."" Another concern was that with such strong winds and only being able to tie the front of the dirigible to the moor, the back would swing around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" The final challenge facing the mooring mast was the prexisting law against low-flying aircraft. This put an end to Al Smith's dreams."	4	4		4																						275	11	309	11	0	0	4.821818181818182	25.0	74	26	25	11	7	26	165	16.6	10.51	8.71	46	12.9	14.71	19.333333333333332	12.3	385
10148	16098	6	The obstacles that the builders faced are flying blimps too low in the area and making the Empire State building taller than its actually supposed to be. Like in @CAPS1 three Al Smith realized that he's in danger of losing his title for world's tallest building. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building would reach a height of 1,250 ft. All he had to do is add a top or a hat to the building and that would make it even taller than any other building in the city. Anothe obstacle they faced was a law about airships flying too low above urban areas. They made this law so no airship would ever tie up with a building. Flying too low is a huge safety hazard; it could take the lives of hundreds of people.	1	2		2																						139	7	151	3	0	0	4.258992805755396	19.857142857142858	38	18	8	7	3	11	78	8.6	6.85	8.03	16	7.5	9.11	11.0	8.0	179
10151	16101	6	"Coming from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State building was to be so much more. The hazards of the gases in some of the Dirigibles was a huge risk because some were flammable. Having the mooring mast in the huge city served potential threats to the safety of the city and population as well. As well is the safety threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds. With the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue the architects had over looked. After all the safety issues and weather problems, there was still the fact that a law forbid the idea. Making the mast idea out of the question. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they would of had to dealt with, the mast was never built, and very unfortunate that after all the planning, there was absolutely no way the dirigibles could ever land there."	2	3		3																						174	9	196	8	0	0	4.563218390804598	19.333333333333332	45	15	12	16	4	20	106	9.7	8.47	7.41	21	8.5	9.33	8.5	10.0	239
10172	16122	6	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was making the mooring mast. this was a problem because it whould add alot of stress to the building, And safety was an issue. I said that the law restricted this Because you can't Put a Blimp over urban areas because if some thing goes wrong alot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task it was very hard to make it to support a Blimp Because there will be to much pressure on the building. lastly safety there were Blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with. If that were to happen in New York alot of innocent lives will be gone.	3	3		3																						143	7	153	2	0	0	4.398601398601398	20.428571428571427	38	20	7	2	2	9	83	13.6	8.43	8.04	17	10.9	13.12	14.0	9.9	185

For instance in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"" This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" This demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"" This justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced"	3	3		3																						172	6	184	3	0	0	4.662790697674419	28.666666666666668	46	21	8	11	1	14	99	22.0	10.17	8.71	20	17.7	19.76	18.666666666666668	13.8	236
10185	16135	6	The obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles. One of them being the Mooring Mast it's self. The building which wasn't strong enough to hold an airship with it's original design. So the building had to be Modified and Strengthened to accommodate this situation. They would add a rocket shaped tower built out shiny glass and chrome-nickel Stainless steel. This tower would illuminate from the inside. Which would bump the building from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors .

10187	16137	6	There was many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One was the weight. The architects could not just place the mooring mast or it would rush the building. So they had to add over sixty thousands of dollars into the framework. Another problem was safty issues. Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles gass. Hydrogen is highly flameable so that catching on fire above New York was dangerous. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so geting pasengers on and off board would be extremly dangerous to them. Also there is a law in New York prohibiting low flying vehecales so the dirigibles could not had dock their in the first place.	3	3		3																						137	10	147	0	0	0	4.7226277372262775	13.7	38	17	10	6	2	13	79	7.7	9.1	7.77	22	6.3	7.82	5.777777777777778	10.4	198
10191	16141	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there. First the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose because the builders didn't notice all the problems it had. One attempt was the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. The builders had a lot of work to do to actually try and fix the problems but there was just to many. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there.	1	1		1																						133	6	143	2	0	0	4.7593984962406015	22.166666666666668	43	20	7	6	3	8	71	12.1	9.81	8.18	22	10.8	11.89	11.8	11.5	193
10197	16147	6	The builders of the empire state building ran into a lot of problems involving the dirigibles.  One problem is that there was no easy way to make such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while making it look good.  The other, most main reason/problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was just a safety issue.  But a big one.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is extremely flammable.  So, if something were to go wrong with docking the dirigible could catch fire and explode & go down in a densely populated area.  There were a lot of safety and structure issues but they were eventually resolved, (like the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible	1	2		2																						134	7	153	4	0	0	4.478571428571429	20.0	34	19	11	9	6	13	73	67.1	10.41	13.56	22	54.0	55.61	10.166666666666666	0.0	198

A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and if this would have happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the accident would have been much worse. Another obstacle they faced, their greatest obstacle, was the power of nature. Air currents were violent, so the winds were constantly shifting and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered to it. One last obstacle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships to fly too low over urban areas, like New York.

The builders when making the mast didn't think deeply about any of these things.The problems the builders would face would appear right after the mast went up. To start the differences in blimps between countries was a factor, because blimps in the @LOCATION2 used helium to keep the dirigible flying but in places outside the states they used hydrogen which is flammable. This is a major issue for a place like New York that is densely populated. Another safety issue that they can't control was nature, the high winds atop the building would move the back of the blimp around and also when landing the window may push the blimp into the mast which would puncture the dome. Both these safety reasons were why blimps are landed on the ground. However even without both of these reasons there was a legal issue, a law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas.

To solve this, Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building. This would allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers off and on.Another obstacle for allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the stress being added to the building's frame because of a one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether. To accommodate the situation, the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened and modified. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The final and greatest obstacle for successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Lead weights would be used to weight down dirigibles landed in open fields. But losing the lead weights at the Empire State building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not very safe at all.	3	3		3																						207	11	229	5	0	0	4.798076923076923	18.90909090909091	70	25	10	8	5	18	111	11.6	10.1	8.32	34	10.2	11.18	15.75	11.8	302

The builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat. Most of the problems presented for the most part were concerning safety. Due to safety issues the mast was considered to lucrative and idea, and posed too much of a danger. There were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. One of these issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flamable gases, that if something went wrong a flamming dirible coming down on down town New York City would cause major damage. Another obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the dirible tethered to the mast would be ""constantly shifting due to the violent air currents (para @NUM1).

So if what happened to the Hindenburg happened at the empire state building then the accident would of been much worse. Especially with people walking the streets below, stated in paragraph @NUM2. Another problem was nature. The winds were ferocious at the top of he building and were always shifting. So if a dirigible was docked to the mask and the lead weights that keep the dirigible from floating away, like anchors, would be dangling over pedestrians ready to fall in an instant, stated in paragraph @NUM3.

10430	16380	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the height of the building. First, due to the alleged, projected height of the mast there were concerns on how to evenly distribute the dirigible's weight. The structure of the dirigible and the fact that it was lighter than air was crucial to understand. Taking this into account, the builders had to figure out how to have the whole building support the dirigible's weight and not just the top mast. Had the dirigible be supported by only the mast itself, the dirigible's weight would probably pulled the mast right out of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. The mast was not made in a business fashion, but more of an extravagant manner, with much of it made out of glass because of many windows. This made the mast's installation a lot more harder because they had to watch the mast be installed from all areas. The builders faced many obstacles in making sure that the Empire State Building was acceptable for dirigible docking.	2	2		2																						192	9	211	6	0	0	4.8125	21.333333333333332	51	22	17	8	3	15	116	11.9	10.04	7.57	29	9.2	11.44	12.2	11.9	276
10437	16387	6	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacles the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the buildings frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it will invole the the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework of the building will cost too much money. The stress of the building will come from the dirigibles's load and wind pressure. Another Obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constinously shift. They didnt wand to use lead weights because it was to dangerous. because they were dangling high over predestrains. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock.	3	3		3																						173	11	188	0	0	0	4.820809248554913	15.727272727272727	50	28	8	8	1	14	97	9.9	9.92	7.69	26	7.7	9.46	7.7142857142857135	10.1	238
10439	16389	6	Builders faced many problems with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. The first problem they faced was the wind at the top of the building. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock at the building, the wind wouldn't allow it to get close enough without moving out of control like hitting another building. This made it impossible for the dirigible to dock and so the Los Angeles gave up. Another reason builders faced a problem with with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, was that there was a law that said airships were not @CAPS2 to fly low over urban areas. This law would prevent any and all dirigibles from coming near the building and therefore they wouldn't be able to dock.	2	2		2																						130	6	140	2	0	0	4.638461538461539	21.666666666666668	34	20	9	4	3	7	72	11.3	9.05	6.9	15	9.4	9.6	11.8	10.5	184

Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers. this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low.

10443	16393	6	The Empire State Building wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on top. To do this the would need to build a mast on top so that the dirigibles could hook on to and refuel. They ran into a lot of problem right off the bat and kept running into them. The first problem, of many, was that they could not just plop a mast on the top because it would be to unstable and cause to much stress to the structure. To prevent that what they ended up doing was modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole costing over sixty thousand dollars. Once they figured out how to equal out all of the wind pressure, they had to think of how to bring the dirigibles in, the answer was simple electrical winches. The next problem was safty, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen and if that blew up it would not be good for the densely populated city below. Another safety issue was nature's violently shifting winds and to solve the problem on the ground they would waive the back down with lead weights to keep it from sweying, but doing that in the air over a lot of people could be unsafe. The final nail in the coffin to this plan was that there is a law for bidding airships to fly too low over urban areas.	3	4		4																						232	9	248	6	0	0	4.293103448275862	25.77777777777778	47	35	15	8	7	16	146	11.7	7.49	7.84	35	9.8	12.04	11.2	10.3	311

With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land. Although the bricks keep the tail from moveing around, having them hang over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not save. In the end the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was disbanded due to many problems that could arise.	3	3		3																						190	10	203	3	0	0	4.705263157894737	19.0	58	23	11	5	5	17	105	10.3	9.63	7.49	25	8.3	10.13	7.571428571428571	10.6	267

10549	16499	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin, the architects were unable to just drop the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This was due to the fact that a dirigible held by a cable would add stress to the building's frame. Though this was an obstacle, the architects spent over @MONEY1 on modifications to the frame to remedy the problem.Another major problem with the idea of the mooring mast was general safety. First off, most foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, as compared to helium, to stay aloft. This problem lay within the fact that hydrogen was highly flammable, and after the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1937, architects became concerned that the same accident could occur over downtown @LOCATION1.In addition, the mast idea proved unsafe due to violent wind currents. To keep from blowing around, dirigibles needed lead weights, which couldn't be allowed to dangle over busy city streets. In conclusion, a final obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban a city. This made it legal for all airships to tie up or ******** this area. Those were the obstacles facing the architects.	4	4		4																						202	11	235	11	0	0	4.975369458128079	18.454545454545453	58	27	19	9	2	25	105	12.3	10.85	8.72	42	9.9	11.42	12.8	12.7	305

This mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station, which, at the time, blimps were very unsafe, and  lacked a suitable landing area so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off. A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, and took over sixty thousand dollars' to do so. After Construction took place, it was then decided if an incident, such as the Hindenburg occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. But the largest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, due to violent air currents, and although tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, the usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe.

Another problem was working with nature. There were violent air currents constantly shifting atop the building, causing the back of ships to swivel around the mooring mast. The dirigibles couldn't simply be weighed down in the back, because that would be a safety hazard. The last problem builders faced was the law. At the time, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities.

Al Smith, who was the one who designed the building, wanted to make the building taller. He did this by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast at the top of the building, reaching 1,250 feet high. There was obstacles in the way of attaining this goal. Safety was the greatest reason why it was never used as a docking station. Hydrogen was used in the dirigibles, which was highly flammable. An accident had already occurred having to do with a dirigible, called Hindenburg, in New Jersey. As popular as New York is they couldn't take the risk of putting harmful, dangerous gases in a densely populated area. Another problem that occurred to stop this building from being used as a mooring mast was the powerful wind currents that constantly shifted. The dirigible would be dangling high over pedestrians swivelling around because of the wind, this made it very unsafe and not even practical. One last reason the Empire State Building would not be able to have a mooring mast in which dirigibles could land was because there was a law which stated airships were not allowed too low over urban areas.

It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return” the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance”. This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again”, because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started."	3	3		3																						220	7	245	15	0	0	4.531818181818182	31.428571428571427	48	36	6	14	12	28	127	15.6	8.95	7.71	25	12.0	14.01	19.0	10.3	283
6003	9559	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has meaning. The author is saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance she too, will get hers. For example, the geese will get to return, the hibiscus will get it's chance to bud and she will get her chance to take her drivers test. I know this because Saeng’s mother starts talking about how great the plant will be in the spring. She even says, “But its strong enough to make it through the cold months”. This indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance. That is why the story ends with that sentence.	2	2		2																						116	6	127	4	0	0	4.396551724137931	19.333333333333332	27	21	4	3	2	13	75	7.6	7.31	7.05	12	5.0	8.02	8.0	7.4	144

In the story there are some quotes to support my response “I-I failed the test” Saeng said.” This shows that she was taking a test about gardening. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life of it to them. The paragraph talks about spring, and flowers.

6088	9644	4	There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique.

The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, “… she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes”[No]. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and that she does not like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, “…she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac”[Ho]. This proves how even though she @MONTH1 not like things at times, Saeng is willing to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, “…she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now “[@NUM1].Saeng is getting more and more used to her surrounding and is adopting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese.	3	3		3																						230	10	258	13	0	0	4.261802575107296	23.3	42	35	14	12	6	28	147	10.4	7.2	7.04	16	7.5	10.42	8.0	9.1	282
6120	9677	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for a reason. The hibiscus reminds her of Vietnam. The geese remind her of her home now. These two things make her strong.

So I do agree with this author and how he ended the story.	1	1		1																						123	5	129	0	0	0	3.6850393700787403	25.4	18	24	6	7	3	8	74	8.8	5.0	7.06	8	7.9	9.93	12.75	5.7	149

Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of her homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, “that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable.	1	1		1																						241	12	263	10	0	0	4.508196721311475	20.333333333333332	51	35	14	16	10	27	136	12.1	8.94	7.66	29	10.3	11.6	8.666666666666666	10.8	327

Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn’t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus Saeng says to herself, ….In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says “hibiscus is budding”, and “the geese return”, It must be a test that you can only take once a year. because she says that “In the spring"" she will take the test again."	1	1		1																						143	8	157	5	0	0	4.1875	18.0	32	24	5	7	7	18	85	10.4	6.85	6.69	7	7.9	9.8	8.0	7.8	176

6214	9771	4	The author concludes  the story  with  that paragraph  for many reasons. One reason is that the author is trying to say that she is going to overcome  the obstacle  (the test)  no matter what. In the text is say “it can make through  the  cold months. ” @CAPS1 consumer her which supports the last paragraph also, she is in a new country and is starting a new beginning.

Saeng says that when “this hibiscus is budding,  then I will take that test again.” Just as the hibiscus blooms Saeng will bloom forth and strive through the winter to try and succeed in passing her test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she can’t be sad forever. She must be determined in order to pass the test. The next season will be a sort of renewal, starting fresh and coming out beautiful as does a hibiscus in bloom.	2	2		2																						96	6	104	2	0	0	4.556701030927835	16.166666666666668	22	17	6	5	4	13	51	9.8	8.88	7.88	14	8.4	10.18	11.6	11.2	134

She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. “I mean it’s not like the kind we had at – at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” (Ho, @NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else."	2	2		2																						133	8	154	13	0	0	4.2611940298507465	16.75	34	21	5	8	3	26	77	20.9	7.45	8.68	13	15.8	19.52	18.333333333333332	12.5	166

The plant has to try hard to produce flowers, and the seen has to care out to melt the snow, so that means when it comes around to it  she needs to comes out and melt all of her had habits and get what she meads to do to pass the test.

6248	9805	4	The author ended the story this way because the plant represents new beginnings in which Saeng needs. Seang failed her test & needed some comfort. She went to the greenhouse & spent @MONEY1 on a hibiscus plant that reminded her of her home. It the same time the hibiscus plant reminded her that her new home is another new beginning. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng better hopes that starting over can be a good thing & that the next time she takes the test, she'll pass.	2	1		2																						86	5	93	1	0	0	4.476744186046512	17.2	25	14	6	1	3	9	40	8.7	8.58	7.5	9	7.4	8.57	10.4	10.8	114
6257	9814	4	The author concludes the story with that story because she loves her homeland and love’s nather and loves her mother.

6258	9815	4	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well, but leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action.	1	1		1																						45	2	48	1	0	0	5.2	22.5	13	8	4	2	2	6	23	14.3	12.77	9.31	10	12.1	14.33	14.25	0.0	74
6269	9826	4	The author concludes the story with paragraph because it shows Saeng’s sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she dissappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her mom’s gardening, she says, “Here, let me help, mother,” because her mom’s frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, “Saeng didn’t dare look her mother in the eye,” which shows Saeng’s concern for her mother’s reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, “It’s a beautiful plant, I’m glad you got it,” which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saeng’s sympathy to better   herself is shown in the story’s conclusion.	1	1		1																						139	6	160	17	0	0	4.714285714285714	23.333333333333332	32	27	10	3	2	32	67	12.4	9.52	7.85	13	10.0	11.29	11.2	10.5	190
6292	9849	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.” She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself so she made a vowe to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her.	1	1		1																						86	4	94	5	0	0	4.395348837209302	21.5	16	16	1	7	4	12	54	13.6	8.19	7.81	10	10.9	13.81	16.0	10.5	112
6295	9852	4	The author decides to end the story with the paragraph to show many things. First of all, the author uses the ending paragraph to show optimism. The whole story had been sad but the ending shows some hope. In the beginning it says, “ @CAPS1  of loss so deep… “(@NUM1) and at the end it says, “ I will take that test again.” (@NUM2) shows how her  attitude   changes from cynical to hopeful. Another reason why the story is ended with that paragraph is to show how Saeng was accepting. When the story says that the geese were  , “ almost familiar to her now.”(@NUM2) demonstrates that even though Saeng is sad to leave her home, she is adapting quite well. Therefore, the author ends the story with an inspiring paragraph to show change for the better.	2	2		2																						137	7	158	6	0	0	4.338028169014085	20.285714285714285	34	21	9	7	2	21	77	9.4	7.66	7.15	14	7.3	9.52	8.333333333333334	9.2	183
6296	9853	4	"The author is concluding the story with that parapraph stating when spring and @DATE2 comes again then she will take the test again. Meaning she will plant the flowers and get them to grow again. Hoping she don’t fail at doing so.

6298	9855	4	I say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy. She was still going to take it again, she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day from failing her driver’s test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower so she went to a florist to see if she can buy it. When she does purchase it she goes home and gives it to her mom and they plant it. So maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck I think.	1	2		2																						107	6	113	1	0	0	3.8878504672897196	17.833333333333332	15	21	6	9	4	7	69	7.6	4.93	6.76	9	6.9	10.43	11.0	8.8	127
6303	9860	4	The author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an end. Wit  this saeng tell @LOCATION1 that all the snow is gone she will take the test again. If one read   now between the lives it   says more than just this. She really likes the hibiscus and when the hibiscus goes back to life in the spring, she will have new energy to take the test again. From her experience with the hibiscus we can see that this plant really influent her. Because this  plant reminds  her so much of her old home.  Also we can see that everything and everybody should get a second chance. In her case it is the test she wants to take again. Also in the spring she lives a couple month in the @LOCATION1 and she will adjust herself to this new situation. At the moment she is just homesick, even if her home is the @LOCATION1 now. So the hibiscus is good for her, it is some think she can hold onto from her old home	2	2		2																						174	11	193	3	0	0	4.055555555555555	16.363636363636363	33	22	9	16	3	16	117	6.8	5.97	6.13	13	6.5	8.57	7.7142857142857135	10.4	232
6306	9863	4	The last paragraph means only one thing. That one thing is to be like a Hibiscus @CAPS1 to take the test again of life. See will come back in the spring just like the Hibiscus will.

6317	9874	4	The author concludes the story like that to show emphasis.Saeng vowed that so that it will teach her everything lives with hope & adaptation. She means that when everything returns and proves they survive, she will too. She will take that drivers test then. The author also wants to prove that people need to have faith in theirselves. You just need to get used to their surroundings. This is why the author concluded that way.	1	2		2																						75	7	84	1	0	0	4.644736842105263	10.857142857142858	14	18	0	4	2	8	46	7.2	8.8	7.02	9	4.5	7.08	6.25	8.8	99
6336	9893	4	By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story “winter Hibiscus,“ the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of seang at her struggle to live in another country & her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating statement on the test saying “ I will take that test again,” the author gives us that understanding that Saeng has not given up & lets the reader know she will stand & live strong.	2	2		2																						115	4	120	3	0	0	4.356521739130435	28.75	28	19	6	4	3	11	60	18.3	8.72	8.02	13	15.5	17.42	19.666666666666668	13.0	160

In Vietnam there were many beautiful wild flowers. Sarng goes to the flower shop to get a peice of home. It said the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind.” This shows that the plant was not the same because there were also no buds.

6363	9920	4	The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The begining was very negative with Saeng failing her drive’s test and her mother yelling at her. But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will peservere wheras before she was so upset, @CAPS1 when she said, “I-I failed the test.” Then for Saeng to refound from this event, gave the reader hope and thats why the author did this.	2	1		2																						89	4	99	3	0	0	4.51685393258427	22.25	24	15	4	3	4	15	51	11.0	8.54	7.76	8	7.3	10.27	11.875	8.1	111
6370	9927	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her and when it is budding she feels stronger. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say “at home.” When she says “and this hibiscus is budding,” I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a “V” so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again.	3	3		3																						144	6	148	1	0	0	3.9097222222222223	24.0	23	22	7	8	3	10	93	15.0	5.76	7.62	9	12.6	14.68	17.333333333333332	7.2	172
6377	9934	4	"The find lines of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" are meant to provide a glimpse into the near future, to show a change in Saeng's attitude. Up until this point Saeng had been lamenting her old country, and not adjusting well to her new one. The Hibiscus inspires her, and lets her know that the new country has many of the same things as her old country. In this last line, she comes to terms with her present situation. ""When the snows melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" is a way of saying shes going to let a little time pass, and by taking her driver’s test again, she will begin her new life."	2	2		2																						117	5	138	9	0	0	4.262711864406779	23.6	27	18	13	2	5	20	65	13.4	7.27	8.06	10	11.2	13.09	14.0	10.1	149
6384	9941	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like this for him/her to have a spin off. I mean to me I think that it mean she is going to try again when spring comes so her and her plant can have a fresh start and I think that is a good way to end it.	1	1		1																						56	3	60	0	0	0	3.5	18.666666666666668	8	10	2	2	2	3	37	9.1	3.03	1.95	1	8.3	11.2	14.0	0.0	61
6389	9946	4	The author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. For example, She writes “she vowed silently to herself.” When you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something. Everything else that she says after that she really means it. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal.	1	1		1																						75	4	82	3	0	0	4.76	18.75	8	15	2	7	0	9	49	10.4	9.69	7.52	9	8.3	10.19	11.375	11.2	106
6392	9949	4	I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.	1	2		2																						77	3	81	0	0	0	4.243589743589744	26.0	10	19	1	3	4	4	52	11.6	7.67	7.17	10	11.0	11.84	14.5	10.5	104
6395	9952	4	The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on.	2	2		2																						181	11	197	5	0	0	4.232044198895028	16.454545454545453	32	31	4	11	9	18	115	6.7	6.44	6.11	13	6.2	7.26	8.0	7.3	228

The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrats this when she says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair.""

6410	9967	4	The author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across. It highlights the things important and familiar to saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that she’ll take the test over again once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she sow the plant , “a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng ‘s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. Therefore by mentioning   the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure.	3	3		3																						235	8	255	13	0	0	4.440677966101695	29.5	56	35	18	17	8	27	129	16.3	8.72	7.86	24	12.8	15.24	18.666666666666668	12.0	312

She later takes a drivers test, but doesn't not succeed in passing, but does succeed in finding comfort from her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph states ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many raesons. These being that Saeng was very upset about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland and the changes she's had to adapt to during this move. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng a hope to continue her jouney even when things get very hard. The winter is this plants time of trouble and sadness, as Saeng's time of trouble and sadness is failing this test and not being at her real home. The end of winter gives both the plant and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope to start over, Saeng will find it easy to get through hardships if she continues to find comfort from her past."	3	3		3																						202	8	229	12	0	0	4.4950495049504955	25.25	60	27	6	9	12	26	116	12.4	8.3	7.55	21	9.6	11.11	10.6	8.5	257

6437	9994	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because when the hibiscus started budding it will give her inspiration to try and past the test again. In order to past the test she wanted to feel like she was home, And to have memories of her home to incourage her to try again.

6447	10004	4	Everything in the story is about to change. The winter will change to spring, the snow will melt and vanish, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will also change and mature as well, Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant as the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and she must adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it matured and grew. That is what Saeng must do she must mature and grow in this new country. For example Saeng observed how different the plant looked in the shop window then in did in her home country. She was observing herself and how different she appeared as well. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already and putting it at the end to show that she had grown. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same effect. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change. Saeng is able to do that as well and she made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured just as the things around her have.	3	3		3																						214	10	230	6	0	0	4.228971962616822	21.4	44	35	12	13	8	15	133	9.2	6.79	6.25	13	6.9	9.12	13.75	9.1	262
6448	10005	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorperating the geese, hibiscus and her drivers test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the drivers test again through memories of Vietnam lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not overconsistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story."	1	1		1																						112	6	125	5	0	0	4.875	18.666666666666668	24	19	8	5	2	12	66	10.9	10.33	8.23	19	8.2	9.98	11.8	10.1	162
6449	10006	4	The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to adjust to her new home and that she will not give up. You can tell that she still misses her homeland by her reaction to seeing the hibiscus plant, but also that she is growing accustomed to her new home because of how she recognizes the geese and will make the decision if when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns.	2	1		2																						82	2	85	1	0	0	4.341463414634147	41.0	15	15	3	2	3	4	51	19.5	8.55	9.14	15	15.7	19.33	23.5	0.0	109
6454	10011	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” which was wrote by Minfong Ho. I believe she put it there because it keeps you asking questions. I think because her mom was so disappointed with her that maybe she can change things and make things better.	1	1		1																						43	3	46	0	0	0	4.534883720930233	14.333333333333334	8	8	2	4	1	6	25	7.1	8.05	7.28	5	5.3	7.58	6.833333333333333	7.8	57
6456	10013	4	I think the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph for these reasons. The first reason is to show that the girl won't give up. She was crying in the store and just very depressed. But, she knows that she has to keep going. It shows a sense of determination. Another reason why I think the author made this the last paragraph is this. It showed her getting used to her environment. I think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together. That way she gets hope from both. For example, in the article it says “many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become….. almost familiar to her now. This shows that she is realizing that she is used to the arrangement right now. So she then gets hope from it. Also, I, think the author did that so that it would add a positive effect on the story. That is why I think the author wrote that as the last paragraph.	2	2		2																						184	14	205	5	0	0	4.232432432432432	13.214285714285714	31	32	8	13	4	21	123	5.3	5.96	6.27	16	4.9	7.43	6.0	8.4	237
6464	10021	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because know matter what she said or did she had to git the flower because it remids her of where she used to live and how It was there so she stared to cry and the test was not to buy the flower and not to cry and that in th spring she is going to grow her own flower.

After discovering that she has just failed a test it becomes more apparent that buying the flower is a way to cope with her new situation in @LOCATION1 and feel comforted by her past. The author is able to conclude the story with that satement because it speaks of moving forward without clinging to the past, In the spring saeng  will have a new home and find strength in her past, that is what I feel the final paragraph suggests	3	2		3																						148	3	156	4	0	0	4.373333333333333	50.0	32	23	8	9	4	10	83	24.1	8.95	9.6	25	20.2	22.42	30.0	13.6	205

In addition, the author also conclude the story with this paragraph to show saeng personal thoughts, and how she feels about this test. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, is a indication that it time to give the test another try. In conclusion, the paragraph is a indication that saeng is never going to forget.	2	1		2																						127	6	139	6	0	0	4.283464566929134	21.166666666666668	31	21	3	2	4	12	78	9.3	7.02	6.8	10	8.0	10.05	10.8	9.7	167

6511	10068	4	The past experiences of our lives often  influence things in our life, weather we consciously know it or not. In this story Saeng  tries to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the cestain  flower that reminels her of her home, when she fails. She is trying to get over the fact that she is not “at home,” that things and people that use to be ground no longer are. But there are new things that she is becoming used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can alway’s  change. She is trying to put things that make her used further  back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year, because it is always possible to do something if you really wants to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng  really wants to pass her own mind test, so she can further adapt to change, her mother will be proud of her.	3	2		3																						178	6	199	10	0	0	3.9239130434782608	30.666666666666668	31	30	7	12	6	22	119	12.3	6.11	6.8	10	10.2	12.55	10.8	9.3	222

Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, so shall she by retaking her driver’s test.

Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that’s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers. Last of all Saeng she sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flowrist shop to see if it can be purchased and Saeng gets highly upset when something goes wrong with them.	0	0		0																						130	4	137	4	0	0	4.276923076923077	32.5	26	19	8	4	6	13	74	20.4	8.03	9.06	14	15.5	18.55	17.666666666666668	9.7	161

Keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn. So this girl didnt just give up. Her plant was like a representation of a new beginning.

When she feels more at home is when she will be ready to take the test again. The text states “run and the geese return"" this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again”. Clearly the geese and hibiscus remind her of home.Once she feels at home, she will feel at ease. Thats why the author concluded with this pasage."	1	2		2																						94	7	105	2	0	0	4.136842105263158	13.571428571428571	21	14	6	5	3	11	57	6.2	6.26	6.27	5	4.6	7.06	7.5	7.8	112
6570	10127	4	"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""It’s-it’s not a real one, ‘Saeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-at’ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on.” One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. “Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.” The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus."	3	3		3																						357	21	406	18	0	0	4.494413407821229	17.047619047619047	76	56	32	30	9	45	204	11.7	8.36	6.85	29	9.0	11.09	13.5	10.2	472
6575	10132	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story the character ” Saeng” is feeling homesick and has not adapted to her new country. She is on her way home from her driver’s test, which she just failed, and on the way she sports a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hishiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort in time of disappoint, connection to her past experiences and ability to overcome obsticales. Saeng has not adjusted to this change in her life and it has affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obsticates in your life but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome it. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and showing the reader that saeng was the hibiscus as her way of overcoming and when she is ready and she has ajusted she will take her driving test again.	3	2		3																						207	8	218	3	0	0	4.51207729468599	25.875	49	26	6	6	10	17	125	12.8	8.88	7.51	27	11.0	13.07	11.6	11.9	286

6586	10143	4	The author end with that paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she has failed this time, more opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times befall her now, good times are still to come. For several reasons, it was a powoful efficient way to end the story.	1	1		1																						54	4	62	4	0	0	4.481481481481482	13.5	10	8	7	5	0	9	32	6.4	7.24	7.23	7	6.2	6.88	6.75	8.8	73
6589	10147	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wants to start planting again. I know this because Saeng life revolves around planting and @CAPS1. Saeng and her mother get there food from what they plant. So all @DATE1 they spend most there time in the garden. growing crops to sell and save. They save for winter and sell to get there equiement to continue whot they do. The part she talking about in the paragraph that say “when they come back” talking about the geese. She loves the geese flying over her head and landing in the yard when she outside on a beauttiful day @CAPS1. when The snow melts she wants to  get back at in the soil on her hands and knee to start planting again. Once the hibiscus start budding everything else starts growing. Saeng live revolves around @DATE1 planting. The author put this paragraph in the story because this is what saeng wants to do more than anything.	1	0		1																						164	12	177	0	0	0	4.545454545454546	13.75	40	35	3	10	6	17	92	8.3	8.35	6.66	13	5.0	7.29	6.285714285714286	6.7	204

6597	10156	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the statement, “...then I’ll take the test again.” This shows that Saeng is willing to try to adapt to this new place she lives in. That is what refers to when she says “test”. For example, in the story she said, “I-I failed the test,” when her mother asked her what was wrong. She spent so much money on that plant hopping to stay home in her mind. She just couldn’t handle that. She ends with the positive statement because it just sends the message that she looks foward to a bright future in her new home.	1	1		1																						106	7	119	5	0	0	4.311320754716981	15.142857142857142	21	18	8	7	0	18	58	7.7	6.55	7.49	6	5.5	8.21	7.833333333333334	7.2	127
6601	10160	4	The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, “.. in the spring...” it’s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It’s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.	3	3		3																						196	10	219	10	0	0	4.182741116751269	19.7	45	31	17	7	9	27	113	10.6	6.68	6.54	14	9.3	11.02	19.333333333333332	10.4	253
6604	10163	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and there is still hope. It is also to teach the reader to have hope and patience and the knowledge that things take time. Saeng failed the test of not giving into her sorrows and misery of missing her country. She says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows that she is adjusting. So by ending it with this and comparing to the geese, its showing that she is getting stronger. She will take the test again because she wont give up.	2	2		2																						124	7	136	5	0	0	4.491935483870968	17.714285714285715	25	21	5	8	5	14	80	10.1	8.24	7.34	14	7.8	10.22	11.0	8.8	164
6606	10165	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didn’t do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it. The author is showing Saeng’s determination to pass the test and do better next time.	1	1		1																						50	2	54	2	0	0	4.36	25.0	13	8	3	4	2	7	32	11.6	7.84	7.4	4	9.5	10.8	13.0	0.0	64
6607	10166	4	I think the author ends the story with that paragraph because it is linting the plant that stands for many positive things to the character that failed the test that the really wanted to pass. Both the character and the plant show perservirance and I think the author is trying to send a message to the reader to never give up on something you want to accomplish. The plant gives an emblem of perseverance because it survives through the harsh winter. The main character isn’t giving up on the test she wants to pass. The author is giving a message not to give up.	2	2		2																						104	6	109	0	0	0	4.4326923076923075	17.333333333333332	23	20	4	2	3	7	61	9.8	8.12	7.86	11	9.0	9.86	11.4	9.9	141
6610	10169	4	The @ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl named Saeng She is a teenager her family just moved to the United States from Vietnam, Saeng failed her driving test and on the walk home discovers this beautiful plant named Hibiscus she falls in love with the Hibiscus. Saeng's mother has a garden she is always planting things a using plarts a veggies from her garden for dinner. The author conclude a paragraph that says where the Hibiscus plants are budding in the spring Saeng with take the test again. I think Saeng says this because she wants to see the beautiful plants When she passes the test and she thinks seeing th Hibiscus will help her passthe driving test.	1	2		2																						117	4	123	1	0	0	4.6239316239316235	29.25	37	23	2	3	2	11	59	15.0	9.76	8.73	14	12.4	12.75	14.5	11.7	158
6613	10172	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that saeng won’t give up. It is possible to adapt and try to love whats around you. Saeng struggled to get out “I-I failed the test” and couldn’t say “at home” this shows her insecurity and lonleiness for the new world around her and by saying she will try again in the spring gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an expirence today that old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now they have some simalarities and because she will try again in the spring means she has decided to go to give a new place a chance.	2	2		2																						120	5	127	0	0	0	4.208333333333333	24.0	23	27	4	4	7	14	75	13.4	7.5	7.49	10	10.3	14.0	14.0	10.7	147
6617	10176	4	The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girls cofidence in herself. It also gives her enough time to get ready for the next test. Also she knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud.	1	1		1																						41	3	44	0	0	0	4.365853658536586	13.666666666666666	7	7	4	2	0	4	26	6.0	7.01	7.01	3	3.9	5.48	5.833333333333333	3.1	51
6622	10181	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing that the hibiscus inspires her and gives comfort that no person could try and do. For example, after Saeng failed her drivers test, she was disappointed. On her way home she saw a hibiscus and went to a florist shop to try and buy it. Saeng took a peddle from the plant and held it tightly while she closed her eyes. The plant reminded her of her real home in vietnam which she loved. The hibuscus became a form of comfort for Saeng since she had just failed her drivers test, even though the plant was not the same as the one at home. By the author ending the story with Saeng saying she will wait until the hibiscus starts budding to take the test again, it shows that the hibiscus helps her to overcome obstacles in life and it helps her to get through hardships she faces.	2	1		2																						162	7	173	4	0	0	4.308641975308642	23.142857142857142	38	31	4	5	6	12	93	10.4	7.61	7.61	18	8.8	10.72	8.333333333333334	9.6	208
6628	10187	4	"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home, and the old, together in harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which relates to the determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently through the winter. A lot of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages hidden within that final sentence It implies that, though the past @MONTH1 be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can be conquered."	1	2		2																						122	6	139	10	0	0	4.901639344262295	20.333333333333332	26	17	7	6	5	18	70	11.9	10.27	8.16	24	10.0	11.39	10.333333333333334	11.5	180

6646	10205	4	The author, Minfong  Ho, concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The  “budding hibiscus” symbolizes comfort for her. When moving to @LOCATION1 she couldn’t take all her friends a possessions with her, but she could bring memories. The flower reminds her of home, which is comforting after she failed her drivers test. In addition, the “geese returning” symbolizes a new beginning. After being away for so long, the geese returning ushers  in springs a time to start all over after a dreasy  winter. Finally “;,.then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 that one should never give up. Even though ve was hard for her to adapt to a new  country, she made friends a tried @CAPS2 foods, like a Big @CAPS3. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the story with the paragraph to show comfort, new beginnings  a never give up.	3	3		3																						142	10	167	11	0	0	4.655405405405405	14.8	37	21	7	11	1	31	76	9.1	9.22	7.76	21	7.1	8.86	7.857142857142858	10.0	205
6648	10207	4	The author concludes the story with the quote, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again,” to show that she is encouraged by the memories of her homeland. For example, in the story it stated that she realized that many things were similar to things in her homeland. As the seasons went by she discovered the similarities. The spring time reminded saeng of her home, so when at comes she will be motivated to take the test again. In conclusion, the author included the quote to show how she is encouraged by memories of her homeland.	1	2		2																						115	5	126	7	0	0	4.469565217391304	23.0	28	19	3	2	3	12	70	11.1	8.36	7.8	17	9.9	13.37	12.2	12.7	158

6702	10261	4	The authors purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return she will have to again take care of the plant.

6707	10266	4	The story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about her “home” where she no longer lived. After she had broke down, bought the plant, and learned to actually accept the fact that she no longer lived in Vietnam and accepting that she had failed her driving test, she realized that she just has to learn to like it. She also learned that her time will come and she will one day be driving. The reason why the auethor concluded the story with this paragraph is because this is the conclusion of the story. this is where one realizes the important things.	1	2		2																						109	5	117	3	0	0	4.458715596330276	21.8	18	21	1	8	4	10	66	13.2	8.48	7.45	12	10.4	13.12	13.75	10.7	141
6708	10267	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a statement that Saeng vowed silently to herself. Saeng says she will take the test again referring to the drivers test. Seeing the geese flying in a “V” and seeing the hibiscus gave Saeng a sense of remembrance to her homeland. Saeng misses he homeland. The author wanted it to seem to the @CAPS1 as if Saeng is starting to feel at home again. The hibiscus is just a symbol to Saeng telling her that It will be @CAPS2.K, and that it’s okay for her to miss Vietnam but also that it’s okay to have a new life, So Saeng, in the spring, will go take her drivers test again with a new attitude and will pass the test.	2	2		2																						132	6	144	6	0	0	4.257575757575758	22.0	36	22	4	7	4	17	72	9.6	6.73	7.84	18	8.3	10.01	8.166666666666666	8.8	169

Saeng “Vowed silently to herself to try again in the spring time.Saeng parchases the hibiscus in remembrance of her homeland, but also to know when it is ready to come back out of the base to try again. The hibiscus does these actions by coming out of its buds and blooming. Ho ends her story in hope of a new beginning.

He doesn't want to just leave us hanging with the girl watching the geese fly away into the distance. The girl felt very bad about failing the test which makes the reader feel sad. To cheer up the reader, he ended the story in this way. Saeng is reminded of home when ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” So, the author ends the story having Saeng have a sense of renewed confidence and the reader feeling happy."	2	2		2																						112	6	123	3	0	0	4.482142857142857	18.666666666666668	25	24	5	4	3	12	59	10.9	8.42	7.57	15	8.5	10.03	11.0	9.4	151
6720	10279	4	The author concludes the story with that because she is determined to succeed in @LOCATION1. She misses her homeland and everything there: gardens, grandparents etc. For example , she walked into the flowershop she smells the flowers like she used to back home. She then smelled a flower that reminded her of her grandmothers “long gray hair, freshly washed …” But by saying that last sentence she said that when the hibiscus budded next winter she will take the test that she failed again.	1	2		2																						84	5	92	3	0	0	4.788235294117647	17.0	16	16	4	5	3	11	47	12.0	10.56	9.04	17	9.0	12.18	12.75	11.7	118
6729	10288	4	This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the atire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flower and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that save her the courage she needed to retake her driver’s test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, “when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...” At first the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story.	0	0		0																						183	8	202	9	0	0	4.461956521739131	23.0	41	23	16	9	10	20	106	12.8	8.36	8.3	26	9.9	12.63	14.5	10.0	238
6731	10290	4	In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again.	2	1		2																						65	5	70	0	0	0	3.6307692307692307	13.0	9	14	4	3	1	5	40	2.2	2.42	5.98	4	3.6	5.2	5.5	3.1	76

The author uses the concludes because when the flower is going to budd and the geese come back she will think that she is back home. Thats why I think the author used the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.	1	1		1																						128	4	139	7	0	0	4.34375	32.0	26	21	3	11	5	10	77	20.3	8.32	7.36	6	15.2	17.71	17.333333333333332	8.8	155

The blomming of the hibiscus symbolizes her old life at her old home and it is also symbolizing a new start when it bloms. This will give her the confodence to pass her driving test and make he excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return”. This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and fells contible, at home you are contible.

6768	10327	4	The author is expressing hope for the future in her concluding paragraph although just failing her drivers test and adjusting to a new atmoshere Saeng finds comfort in a Hibiscus. “it felt smooth an cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel.” This expresses that the rememberence of “an old friend” was able to lift her spirits after a previous dissappoinment it was obvious Saeng was uncomfortable in her environment, which her mother noticed when she arrived at home. “she paused as she noticed the tear stains on her a daughter’s cheecks and her puffy eyes.” Her daughter was not adjusting to her new atmosphere and even though she had spent a lot of money on a single flower she understood. With all the negative attitude through out the story, once Saeng saw the geese and planted her “winter” hibiscus, she realized what was strange to her before had now become familiar. Saeng finally realizes with a memory of home, her goals can be accomplished and life can be stable somewhere other than home. She illustrates that from failurecomes success.	2	3		3																						190	7	200	4	0	0	4.752631578947368	27.142857142857142	45	25	17	8	5	23	102	24.7	10.93	9.41	32	20.6	23.58	61.0	17.4	277

She finishes her story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. By concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test. The hibiscus the helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before, through the quit repition of season upon season, almost femiliar to her now.”  In the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season.	3	2		3																						141	6	154	7	0	0	4.52112676056338	23.666666666666668	37	21	7	9	4	18	77	14.1	8.83	7.95	17	11.9	13.55	11.6	11.6	192

She left us wondering because when she does come back she is going to want use to Read about what happened when she came back and what happened when she @CAPS1 the test.

6827	10386	4	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal.	3	3		3																						243	8	273	21	0	0	4.565573770491803	30.5	48	40	14	20	10	39	144	20.4	9.42	8.37	22	15.5	17.85	29.0	12.7	309

The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons.

6851	10410	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng’s everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home.

6858	10417	4	The author concludes the story by showing the girl’s connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese, the “Winter hibiscus” is her connection to her homeland.

6859	10418	4	The author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. All throughout the story there was depresing nogistalistic tone that made the reader yearn for the past. The author wanted to put on emphisis on being strong even though you @MONTH1 not enjoy where you are at. Also the author wanted to show the strength of the main of the main character Saeng. Even though she has just failed a test in a new, strange world she still wishes to continue pushing foward. This adds more demension the the character and makes her less static and more dynamic. This is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward.	2	2		2																						137	8	146	1	0	0	4.394160583941606	17.125	24	23	13	11	3	14	82	7.8	7.48	7.25	15	6.4	8.59	7.833333333333334	8.5	179
6862	10422	4	“when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author has left her home and moved to another country. She is now in an unfamilar place. Everything that now surrounds her is new and mostly un-known. By ending the story with this quote, it suggest that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home. When she left her home, she did not just leave a building behind. She left her home, people she loved, and an endless list of memories. At times she @MONTH1 have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now “out of the box,” and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and “failed her test.” The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own test of adapting.	3	2		3																						205	12	226	10	0	0	4.195121951219512	17.083333333333332	42	29	13	17	10	26	121	8.6	6.38	6.58	14	6.6	9.37	8.0	8.8	254

6864	10424	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces.	2	2		2																						137	8	151	5	0	0	4.810218978102189	17.125	39	25	5	2	7	18	67	11.0	9.98	8.18	21	8.6	10.18	7.142857142857142	10.6	189
6869	10429	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in that way to convey the determination and new found motivation Saeng found by buying the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, finding a plant that reminded her of her home and her grandmother instilled motivation in her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country workout for the better, no matter what. “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky ...” the author included details about the geese to represent moving on. The geese will go, and come back, just like Saeng. She failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. “Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her.” The geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her, in her new home. Concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home. Finding the plant helped her, because it was already familiar to her. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. ‘@CAPS1, Saeng said.’ “After failing her driver’s test, walking into the florist’s shop and finding that plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting. Concluding the story that way showed the reader that she was adapting and learning to deal with a tough situation in a comforting way.	3	3		3																						296	14	324	13	0	0	4.626262626262626	21.214285714285715	61	53	25	18	10	35	155	16.9	9.53	8.04	39	13.8	15.46	29.5	12.7	403
6876	10436	4	This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring.	2	3		3																						191	9	204	6	0	0	4.183246073298429	21.22222222222222	36	33	7	6	7	18	118	10.2	6.8	6.89	17	7.9	10.4	10.6	8.5	238
6881	10441	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. The next time it blooms the girl will be ready for the test and will take it again and will pass. The authour  wants to show that the girl will not give up and will try again to make sure she passes. The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test.	1	2		2																						87	4	92	0	0	0	3.977272727272727	22.0	16	16	4	2	5	6	58	8.3	5.75	6.17	6	7.1	9.18	11.625	8.1	103
6885	10445	4	Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these tequniques a story @MONTH1 seem bland average or unattractive. Author Minfong Ho canverys the fact that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of simply stating the fact that she will retake the test, he has her make a promise on the geese that she will. The Author ended the story like this show how strongly she felt about the test.	0	0		0																						73	5	79	1	0	0	4.63013698630137	14.6	19	12	4	4	1	11	39	7.7	8.4	7.61	12	5.4	6.39	6.5	5.7	95
6887	10447	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test.	2	2		2																						128	8	139	2	0	0	4.46875	16.0	31	25	6	6	6	13	71	8.8	8.12	7.38	15	6.9	8.88	8.166666666666666	9.2	165
6890	10450	4	The short story “Winter Hibiscus” as written by author Minfong Ho, ends with main character Saeng, promising herself that in the spring when the geese return and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, that she would re-take her failed drivers test. Mingfong Ho, writes this story, with heavy imagery and symbolism, the hibiscus found in the floral shop, represents a connection for Saeng to her homeland, and the bittermellon, which is loved by Saeng, but unbearable to people in @LOCATION1 ,represents Saeng’s hard time connecting to people in @LOCATION1. And for Saeng, the budding hibiscus, and returning geese, are representative of a new opportunity to pass her drivers test, and better adapt to life in @LOCATION1.	3	3		3																						116	3	136	15	0	0	5.181034482758621	38.666666666666664	38	19	11	1	7	22	51	22.3	12.25	9.64	21	17.2	19.62	22.0	17.1	179
6891	10451	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wanted to show that Saeng doesn’t give up and that nature gives @CAPS1 strength. The conclusion shows that Saeng doesn’t give up by saying that she is going to take the test again, even though she failed it earlier that day. Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by saying that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return, when hibiscus buds and when the snow melts in spring nature gives her strength because it reminds her of where they used to live and her grandmother. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature gives her strength and confidence.	2	2		2																						125	4	134	5	0	0	4.672	31.25	35	23	1	5	5	12	72	16.2	9.93	7.97	13	12.0	14.12	18.0	10.7	163

6909	10469	4	I think the author ended the story like that because she enjoys to see the geese and she loves the spring and wants to take the test and pass.

6914	10474	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown. She has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too. nature’s fight for survival is like Saeng’s struggle in a new place. She discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time. Then after that time it will feel just like home. The adaption principle is shown throughout this story demonstrate by nature or a child’s life it’s there. Therefore the author would agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng.	3	2		3																						109	7	116	0	0	0	4.81651376146789	15.571428571428571	27	13	8	6	2	11	60	10.4	9.97	8.6	19	8.0	10.95	8.5	10.5	149

6935	10495	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she failed the test so over the winter they don’t get hibiscus but over the spring when they get again the hibiscus she will try to take the taste again so she can pass it	1	1		1																						46	1	46	0	0	0	4.195652173913044	46.0	9	9	0	3	1	1	31	21.4	7.97	7.98	3	16.5	19.27	25.0	0.0	56

6945	10505	4	Saeng is trying to say that when the time comes again that she will take the test. The author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test. The auther also does this to show that you should never quit like if the flower can survive winter then she will be able to survive that test. Also the author is saying that when the seasons change, things change. She was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence. Also she cherished the plant because she wants to see it budding because her and her mother spent quality time dve to this plant she had.	2	1		2																						133	6	140	1	0	0	4.368421052631579	22.166666666666668	24	29	4	6	3	8	84	10.2	7.78	7.35	13	8.4	10.08	10.4	7.8	167
6946	10506	4	Saeng is talking about her school work and the garden. She always connects the two of them in the same way. she knows that she has to study while the garden grows and she wants to water  the flowers and she is saying that when the spring comes she wont be there for the garden and she will have to take the test.	0	0		0																						63	3	68	0	0	0	3.90625	21.333333333333332	10	12	1	2	4	5	43	12.9	5.93	7.71	4	10.9	12.6	15.75	0.0	73
6948	10508	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that everything and everyone can make it through a tough time. This paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers. The text say, “when they come back... I will take that test again”. This quote shows that Saeng can see herself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She knows that her “winter” is her test and that when she is ready, she’ll be able to take the test again and be successful. The budding of the hibiscus represents the time when she’ll be prepared to take the test. Though she is having a tough tine now, she'll be able to get through it and make another attempt. This paragraph is at the end because it brings together the purpose of the hibiscus. Without saying this, the readers would have never gotten this message, instead, they would believe that the role of the hibiscus was to serve as a connection to Saeng’s past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph was included to show readers that everyone can balance back from a bad situation.	3	3		3																						187	11	205	7	0	0	4.60427807486631	17.0	40	27	11	7	5	23	118	8.7	8.47	7.1	19	7.6	8.73	7.2857142857142865	10.4	253
6954	10514	4	I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time.	0	0		0																						65	2	68	0	0	0	3.8181818181818183	33.0	16	13	0	3	3	6	40	29.3	5.65	9.05	6	23.9	26.62	33.5	0.0	78

When Saeng says,”and this hibiscus plant is budding,"" she is thinking about how the plant reminds her of her native country. Also when she says, ""Then I will take this test again” she is promising herself that she will take the test when she feels at home in her new country. Saeng also is in a way telling herself that she should accept the fact that she has moved and that she can still be reminded of her native country with the new hibiscus plant and many other things."	2	2		2																						137	4	147	4	0	0	4.211678832116788	34.25	32	20	6	4	4	10	87	15.5	7.27	7.41	9	11.9	14.3	17.0	8.1	164
6956	10517	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She could want the people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start up again so will Saeng. Ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and geese restarts their lives Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but instead re-take the test. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves you thinking so then the sequel will be about the start of Saeng’s new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 love having people wonder about whats coming next. The people will go home and wonder what will the author do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer.	2	2		2																						178	12	194	1	0	0	4.264044943820225	14.833333333333334	39	36	9	12	6	15	107	6.0	6.37	6.23	9	4.3	5.92	6.142857142857143	4.8	217
6962	10523	4	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time.	2	2		2																						93	4	100	5	0	0	4.787234042553192	23.5	19	17	9	4	2	14	51	16.9	11.04	9.11	17	14.1	15.76	18.166666666666668	12.5	135
6980	10543	4	There are two reasons why he had conclude the story with this pararagraph. The one reason why the author had conclude the story with the paragraph because Saeng had silently had picked up a Winter Hibiscus so she can have to passed that driving Test. Finally; the last reason why the author had conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to try her driving Test again so she can passed so she can also drive when she gets down passing it. These two reasons were so confusing to figure out what the author conclude in the story with that sentence.	1	1		1																						102	4	107	0	0	0	4.5	25.5	20	16	2	5	0	6	64	12.5	8.83	7.07	9	9.7	10.98	13.25	8.1	136
6982	10545	4	There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time.	3	3		3																						164	9	186	11	0	0	4.502958579881657	18.77777777777778	35	25	9	16	3	30	96	16.8	9.53	8.54	19	12.5	15.07	13.5	10.4	212
6983	10546	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus when Saeng says that she will take the test again in the spring, so she can walk home and see the flower that she found. Also in the story it mentions that in her past childhood she had seen the same flower in her country, but the next time she takes the driving test she would like to pass. It shows that she was disapointed because in the story it say that she paid over nineteen dollars for the test. Her mother was astionished, and yelled at her for a second. Saeng began crying and her mother calmed to show sympathy for her. Now she has the determination to take the test again.	1	1		1																						118	6	127	3	0	0	4.203389830508475	19.666666666666668	23	23	3	5	4	11	75	8.2	6.67	6.62	9	7.4	9.57	10.6	8.3	150
7000	10563	4	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with a sentence stating that when Saeng’s Hibiscus’ first bud appears in the spring she will be back to take drivers test. The author might have decided to conclude the story like that because what if the plant died, would she go back and take the test? The author was probably just wanting the reader to think hard about it. In conclusion, the author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” might have concluded his story to make it somewhat suspenseful.	1	1		1																						89	4	95	2	0	1	4.719101123595506	22.25	22	13	4	6	1	10	51	11.9	9.99	7.4	13	9.6	11.62	13.125	11.2	126
7006	10569	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because if the author trys it again it might work out a lot better now they know what they are doing. Also if they try it again then if it makes enough they can sell it and make money so they will keep doing it for years to come.	0	0		0																						60	2	62	0	0	0	3.9166666666666665	30.0	8	12	1	6	1	2	43	12.0	5.82	6.7	3	10.3	12.0	15.0	0.0	72
7012	10575	4	The author includes this paragraph inorder to show an end to the story and to  show that Saeng has not given up. Ho wanted to show how the plant and the geese represented the continueation of Saeng’s life in the United States. The geese will come back and the Hibiscus will bud and flower, and Saeng will retake and  hopefoly pass her diving test. This paragraph is not just a colosing but a new beginging of life for geasse, a Winter Hibiscus, and Saeng.	1	2		2																						84	4	93	3	0	0	4.325581395348837	21.5	28	10	3	2	8	14	46	9.8	7.78	7.5	13	9.1	10.3	11.75	9.5	114
7015	10578	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to that she still has hope of finding home and being happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. So when the plant budds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy, that is when she will take the driving test. Also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting acustomed to the new home and lifestyle, “A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks deer and–yes–familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.” Through these examples I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show Saeng assimilation into her new lifestyle, and her acception of her situation.	3	2		3																						160	6	175	10	0	0	4.70625	26.666666666666668	36	18	12	15	5	20	94	16.8	10.05	7.79	22	13.4	15.8	14.0	12.7	227
7020	10584	4	Saeng concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows what she has just been through and feels she could go through it again. If she fails the driving test again, then she use the plants to overcome her problems. She @MONTH1 actually pass the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and believes now that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood.	1	1		1																						76	4	81	1	0	0	4.671052631578948	19.0	13	14	3	6	2	7	47	10.1	9.34	8.32	10	6.0	9.71	10.5	8.8	94
7027	10591	4	The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the “Madagascar periwinkle” growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.	1	1		1																						124	6	131	1	0	0	4.548387096774194	20.666666666666668	25	18	5	10	1	12	73	10.3	8.76	8.1	14	7.8	9.89	11.0	9.3	160
7030	10594	4	The author concludes the story with, ‘when they com back, saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 then she will become more familiar. For example, the author says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become , through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her now.” That tells me that she feels that over same time , she will become more familiar with driving and then she will take the test again. Then she @MONTH1 pass it	1	1		1																						112	7	123	9	0	0	4.575221238938053	16.142857142857142	21	16	8	14	3	18	68	14.4	9.41	7.73	12	11.7	13.18	19.333333333333332	11.2	152
7031	10595	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to @LOCATION1 and has had a rough time fitting in. She misses everything about her old home, from her grandmother to the old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels that all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the winter and bloom in the spring and that is what Saeng realizes she must do. The last paragraph said “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring is the time for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers start to bloom, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes she wants a new beginning as well to be brought I the spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph ties the theme of new beginnings into the story. It shows @CAPS1 new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it.	3	2		3																						191	11	210	8	0	0	4.492146596858639	17.363636363636363	49	31	15	5	8	26	102	9.3	8.12	7.06	20	7.2	9.32	7.7142857142857135	11.0	254
7033	10597	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. First, when the hibiscus buds in the spring that means that the plant is about to bloom. That also means that Saeng will be ready in the spring to take the test again. Also the last paragraph is at the end because if the plant can make it, then the girl can pass her drivers test and be happy both ways.	1	1		1																						72	4	78	2	0	0	4.222222222222222	18.0	17	8	5	5	1	7	47	7.4	6.44	6.28	5	5.6	7.76	8.5	7.2	87
7037	10601	4	The author concludes this story with the few words “then I will take that test again.” because she wanted us to know that she is not going to give up on something she failed once.

7048	10612	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” in the spring come back the new hopes ,comfort belive, As  she said in the story “in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again.” She hear when the hibiscus comes back brings new hopes to the life to take that test for. Here the hibiscus mean  hope. Second of all when she said “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding “ she  means that is comfort for her it strong than hope and more if her mom helps her blue in her  self because is not easy to do it without her mom comfort. Lastly she said”Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and yes familiar to saeng  now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of a strange before had became, through the quiet repetitions of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She mean that the season is coming and the hibiscus  grow she will regain the blive  and the strength that she need to have to take the test the hibiscus means a lot to her means vew  hopes ,comfort, and belive.	2	3		3																						204	8	225	8	0	0	4.1415094339622645	26.5	47	27	17	12	8	22	114	19.0	7.91	7.36	10	15.7	17.3	18.333333333333332	12.3	268

7056	10620	4	I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her.	2	1		2																						152	7	161	3	0	0	4.342105263157895	21.714285714285715	31	27	7	5	4	11	86	14.2	8.02	7.22	16	11.6	14.27	13.75	10.8	204
7058	10622	4	I think the author concludes the story with that saying because it shows that she is adappting to the new place. It @CAPS1 shows that she isent going to give up.

7076	10640	4	The author uses this conclusion for a reason. The reason the author uses this cliff-hanges of a conclusion is to keep the reader interested and wanting more. By saying,”I will take that test again,” the author makes the reader question if Saeng will pass the test next time and the reader will wonder what “the test” is.	1	1		1																						57	4	62	2	0	0	4.631578947368421	14.25	20	8	3	0	2	9	30	9.9	8.99	6.52	4	8.3	8.3	10.5	8.8	78
7077	10641	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesn’t want the snow to melt so that the geese wouldnt return.

7080	11828	5	"Throughout the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, manages to maintain a single overall mood. In many parts of the story he tells about how much he loved his childhood so it lead me to think was nostalgia, but nowhere does it emphasize that he yearns to return to past times. He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became"" family"" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states how his parents were so brave to leave their lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times on how his parents helped so many in need. If in Rodriguez's position I would love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and upbringing of their son."	2	2		2																						167	7	186	9	0	0	4.425149700598802	23.857142857142858	35	22	14	10	6	19	105	11.4	8.01	7.85	24	9.1	11.0	11.0	9.2	220

7321	12069	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is both happy and uplifting but also sad. The examples of how it is happy are the way the author describes in paragraph @NUM1 how his parents were able to afford to move into a better and larger house, ""twenty-one-year-old @PERSON2 and twenty-seven-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, @NUM2-room apartment."" @CAPS1 example of the happiness is when he is describing the time when his parents were decorating the appartment to look like a traditional-cuban home, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" @CAPS1 example of happiness is when he describes his community of united and hard-working immigrants, ""In our neighborhood all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And the final example is when he mentions that lot's of his family and friends grace their kitchen table more times than not. The mood changes about halfway through the memoir in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and carrers in the country they loved."" This is when the parents are leaving Cuba and their families and friends to take on a life in @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 example of sadness is when it says ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" This means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in @LOCATION1, and they might not get the pay they deserve. Those of the various moods set by the author in this memoir."	4	4		4																						275	10	327	11	0	0	4.84	27.5	73	33	27	6	15	36	158	21.0	10.28	8.63	37	16.3	17.9	31.5	15.0	397
7327	12075	5	The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort.	3	3		3																						126	10	138	2	0	0	4.238095238095238	12.6	22	15	12	5	2	11	80	4.8	5.84	5.77	9	4.7	5.67	5.75	7.6	166

Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.""

The reason he is happy, I think is because he has a family that loves him. Even though they're from different cultures they came together and that wouldn't have happened if his parents hadn't immigrated. That is why I think the mood is happy and truely grateful."	2	2		2																						118	9	139	3	0	0	4.516949152542373	13.11111111111111	27	14	9	6	5	15	76	8.3	7.42	7.15	14	7.5	7.78	8.333333333333334	8.8	161

They would always help someone in their family if necesary, and often did. Narciso's family made the best of being poor, and managed to get by. They did all this without loosing their culture (Cuban music and food). Their entire neighborhood, one big family, survived and thrived on little.

This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them.	3	3		3																						168	8	187	9	0	0	4.369047619047619	21.0	38	22	9	9	9	19	107	9.7	7.43	6.46	15	9.1	9.59	8.666666666666666	11.2	231

His parents decided to immigrate to give him a better life, at the expense of their families, friends, jobs, and their country.Another reason why the author was grateful was because the author learned that ""family"" was not just a blood relative, but much more. In the piece of text, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. From this snippet, I can tell that the author was grateful for learning the true meaning of family. He learned a ""family"" was a unity of people that helped each other.The reason why the author was grateful was because of their courage. In the text, the quote, ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" From this quote, I can gather that his parents were grateful. Most people would've given up from the tall and wide barrier in their way. His parents could've given up, but they didn't.

Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank “water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst.

A heat stroke can be fatal to anyone, especially those with heart problems. Dehydration also can be fatal. If the cyclist does not see any buildings, he would not be able to tell where he is and he might get lost because of it. Getting lost will also lead to dehydration, tiredness, and heat stroke.	1	2		2																						127	7	139	5	0	0	4.291338582677166	18.142857142857142	26	19	4	6	6	12	79	7.8	6.78	6.9	16	6.8	8.18	8.0	8.0	166
3674	6070	3	The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists.	2	2		2																						93	4	98	1	0	0	4.67741935483871	23.25	24	11	5	5	4	10	52	12.2	9.81	9.04	22	10.0	11.04	12.625	8.8	133

Halfway through his trip the “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it “Over on long, crippling hill”. The word “crippling“ is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist’s ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding.	1	2		2																						117	8	127	4	0	0	4.52991452991453	14.625	26	17	7	11	4	18	65	8.3	8.12	7.7	15	5.1	8.05	7.666666666666666	7.4	146

If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won’t be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly infront of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist. The conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him.	3	3		3																						156	8	169	6	0	0	4.538461538461538	19.5	38	13	10	10	7	16	96	9.9	8.82	7.77	22	9.6	10.58	11.2	11.0	225

When @CAPS1 hot, the heat dehydrates you. So the narrator was being pushed to the limit because of the heat. Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was hauntinghim until he got mad at the lodgers hetalked to and was really frustrated. The smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills, which made it harder for him to ride. Lastly, the snake inthe road affected him because he had to avoid it.

Meaning that he   didn’t mind or wasn’t   troubled   by it  at the time. But the farther his trip went, the hotter, and less water supply he had left. Once he passed a couple of “troubling sights”, because they were abandoned and no one   was around, he began to worry. The cyclist got to the point that he stated to suck on pebbtes, in order to circulate the last spit he had in his mouth. In his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on.

3738	6134	3	Many features in the setting affect the cyclist. Several main features include the cars lading town. that aint really towns anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could give him water, but it was all run down and weakened. “I arrived at the first “town”. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.” He is saying that the town could’ve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed He tried to pump water but got no success. “I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t cool down.” A working water pump would’ve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading	2	2		2																						155	11	170	5	0	0	4.458064516129032	14.090909090909092	44	23	12	10	8	21	83	10.6	7.83	7.99	20	8.4	9.61	10.6	8.8	203

Early on in the story the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tatalizing sips."" With more miles to go,the cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to  add to his misfortune, ""flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the hills are short, they still could have put impact on him because of the ropolalive hills.

Also that the water felt around two-hundred degrees. That sweat was all over him. So he had to be really hot. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performence. How was because he was dieing in need of water. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong and the trip wasnt what he expected. But in the end he was relifed. So even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive.

3784	6180	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically.	3	2		3																						225	17	250	10	0	0	4.702222222222222	13.235294117647058	47	33	23	8	9	33	125	8.7	8.93	7.17	27	7.2	7.86	10.8	8.2	305

3815	6211	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason the features of the setting affect him is because it is hot outside which makes him need more water. An example of this is “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 example of being hot outside is “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.”	1	1		1																						80	3	84	2	0	0	4.8375	26.666666666666668	21	9	5	5	1	10	41	14.7	10.57	8.71	16	12.5	12.68	15.333333333333334	11.2	121

3825	6221	3	The setting in the story greatly affected the cyclist. The main setting was that he was riding his bike in the desert. The desert is really hot so he needed more water than he would have if he were riding in the woods or if there was snow. Also there was hills on his travel that he had to ride his bike up which takes more  energy so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat, finally, because of the terrain he was riding on the animals he ran into, a snake, could have hurt him. Because the setting of the story was in the desert the cyclist was affected more then he had thought he would be.	2	2		2																						123	5	133	4	0	0	3.9919354838709675	24.8	23	16	6	8	1	10	83	9.8	5.87	6.4	8	9.3	10.82	13.75	9.4	157
3827	6223	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who haven’t seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldn’t have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldn’t have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his “dehydrated state.” I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldn’t focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldn’t get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite.	3	2		3																						181	10	198	7	0	0	4.49171270718232	18.1	42	35	4	8	4	21	108	8.8	7.89	7.24	19	8.0	8.79	8.0	9.1	250
3843	6239	3	Setting is a very important element to the story “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit: by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative, for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1 the story would not be as interesting.	3	0		2																						160	7	177	7	0	0	4.94375	22.857142857142858	44	15	21	8	7	18	85	13.3	11.09	7.73	25	12.2	12.66	10.666666666666666	14.1	256
3847	6243	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration.	2	2		2																						137	9	157	9	0	0	4.7898550724637685	15.333333333333334	36	17	12	7	4	17	77	8.9	9.33	7.73	23	6.9	8.71	7.7142857142857135	9.7	196
3849	6245	3	"The features of the setting affect the cy clist in many ways. For example the lack of water was the biggest thing. Without cool water he had nothing to reboost his energy. He would get tired out faster. Even he does find water its hot, like when he says,” brakish water feeling some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This shows how in “the high desert of June,"" the water is all very hot. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes the water still wouldn’t cool down the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot. Also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it. We know the roads rough when he says, “large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.

3856	6252	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the road could be damaged or there could be a lot of hills. One example is on pg @NUM1 “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat”. This explains the conditions of the road could be dangerous. That is how the condition of the road can be affective.	1	1		1																						62	4	65	0	0	0	4.129032258064516	15.5	16	6	2	0	2	8	37	5.8	5.91	7.97	9	5.8	8.78	8.0	9.5	79

But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and cough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence, as he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terain he says,"" i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the queruring that he says,"" i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”.

3867	6263	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the @DATE1 then his water supply would’ve lasted longer and he would’ve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would’ve died. Luckily though it wasn’t and he was able to drink water.The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice something the cyclist could’nt do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him. Since I’ve fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy.	3	3		3																						197	11	212	3	0	0	4.47979797979798	18.0	40	34	6	17	5	19	117	10.7	8.41	7.05	18	9.5	10.38	11.4	11.0	270
3874	6270	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly in his determined ride. At first he seemed at case talking about the cool pines and rushing rivers he was going to encounter once getting to Yosemite. After a strenuous ride he started to get nervous and wonder if he was even going to survive. He was running out of water and he thought be a diamondback. Once he reached the rolling hills he saw a posted speed limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m.p.h. He was doing a ''water depleting 12 m.p.h. wonder how he was going to survive. At the end of the rolling hills he came to an old Welch’s grape factory wondering his life was so cruel. After that he was determined to survive and make it to his destination. He picked out spoke on horizon and rode to them makes his way across the desert. The finally made it to “Only and wilbers fish camp where he know he was safe and would survive.	2	3		3																						173	11	185	0	0	0	4.271676300578035	15.727272727272727	31	38	9	7	7	12	95	7.3	6.61	8.15	23	6.5	8.54	8.166666666666666	8.8	228

3883	6279	3	The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards. The weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough, but giving through a desert with limited water had to be miserable. The warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigue. This delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well. Not only did he have to through tough weather but hazardous condition too. There were times when “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”. This delayed him and took time to cycle around. As you can see this was a difficult journey for the reader and the affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						116	8	124	1	0	0	4.672413793103448	14.5	24	15	12	9	8	10	68	7.8	8.75	7.49	18	6.6	8.56	7.142857142857142	9.2	159
3885	6281	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																						200	11	223	11	0	0	4.57	18.181818181818183	45	30	16	9	8	27	119	10.1	8.53	7.71	27	8.7	11.0	10.666666666666666	11.6	286
3888	6284	3	After the cyclist spoke to the “old timers who hadn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded.	3	3		3																						177	8	193	9	0	0	4.5875706214689265	22.125	43	30	10	7	10	25	91	10.0	8.76	8.27	30	8.6	10.14	8.166666666666666	10.3	247

He sweat to much to the point that he lost an enormous amount of bodily fluids. The cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved.

Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he’s doing in weather that he could, “drop from heatstroke.” @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he’s seeing a mirage of a “building-abandoned years ealier.” The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in.	2	3		3																						87	4	93	1	0	0	4.64367816091954	21.75	21	14	6	4	0	10	50	14.9	9.7	8.34	13	12.2	12.98	16.166666666666668	10.5	124

This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory.

The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water.

If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, “ghost town” infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; “there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn’t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid.

It can get very hot there,like the writer describes, “wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.” The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed.	2	2		2																						129	9	148	9	0	0	4.682170542635659	14.333333333333334	37	18	5	7	1	21	74	8.7	8.7	7.01	16	7.2	7.68	6.857142857142857	8.1	181

Actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town.

He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do.

4074	6470	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him” no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclution of the setting, having only seen “One ramshackle shed in many miles, the cyclist almost looses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of “the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.” That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope.	2	2		2																						112	4	125	9	0	0	4.455357142857143	28.0	33	13	4	5	3	20	60	13.6	8.01	8.83	20	11.8	13.34	14.0	10.7	152

4088	6484	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with “His name written over them”. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. “That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map.	3	3		3																						179	9	192	5	0	0	4.290502793296089	19.88888888888889	47	26	14	6	4	19	93	10.0	7.43	7.57	22	8.5	11.64	8.666666666666666	11.0	239
4089	6485	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, “I arrived at the first “Town”…this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, “short, rolling hills” (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn’t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist’s journey in a negative way.	3	3		3																						255	11	286	15	0	0	4.412451361867705	23.363636363636363	64	31	25	9	4	35	145	11.1	8.07	7.88	37	10.0	11.95	14.5	10.4	346

4115	6511	3	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclist’s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speaker’s journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																						97	8	107	2	0	0	4.546391752577319	12.125	31	10	3	2	1	11	57	6.1	7.58	7.0	9	4.5	6.08	5.8125	8.1	128
4128	6524	3	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he/she thought they would die. The setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat. Finally the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men because the cyclist didn’t make it where he/she wanted to go.	2	2		2																						77	5	87	1	0	0	4.753246753246753	15.4	18	12	5	4	2	8	47	8.6	9.39	7.27	10	6.9	7.72	7.5	8.2	110

4133	6529	3	The setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike. He was smiling and his legs were strong. As he hit the @NUM1 town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water. As the flat rodes were replaced wI short, rolling hills he became even more troubled.  When he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to Yosemite. As the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless.

4138	6534	3	The settings to this story has an encouraging impact on this story, because he is an alike ride. The terrain in the story sounds rough where he seen a sign marked, ‘Rough road ahead do note exceed posted speed limit.” He already has to go up and down hills with rocks and no water. Such a setting an a really athletic ride can be devastating.	1	1		1																						65	4	70	2	0	0	4.276923076923077	16.25	15	9	5	4	2	7	36	9.6	6.96	7.87	9	9.4	10.53	12.166666666666666	9.7	88
4139	6535	3	The feature of the cyclist and the settings arn’t that good. There’re insidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn’t have any energic to get up. There’re some interesting sence in the story.	2	2		2																						174	11	188	1	0	0	4.045977011494253	15.818181818181818	37	28	9	9	5	24	104	5.6	5.33	7.41	10	4.7	7.24	5.875	7.7	215
4142	6538	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when you have hills to climb and little water, you will get dehydrated. Also the heat from the desert is so hot that it also can make you dehydrated. If you don’t  pace yourself and dont drink too much water you will be able to reach your goal. Your rest is a big thing for if you dont have energy, you will not get far.	0	0		0																						74	4	83	2	0	0	4.026666666666666	18.75	13	10	5	5	2	7	49	7.0	5.86	6.47	5	7.0	8.48	9.0	8.1	94
4153	6549	3	There were several features of the setting that held an affect on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert. This condition normally prevents one from obtaining water. Seeing as how water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack there at due to the desert created the conflict of dehydration. Additionally, the town that was abandoned triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclist’s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope. By the time he/she reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now his head is screaming with annoyance and his body is screaming with lack of water. This abandoned juice factory almost completely wiped out the cyclist hope. A man is little to nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative affect on him. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her desperation of survival, an instinct in all of us. In conclusion, the desert removed water and the abandoned homes and factory removed hope and all three created a negative affect. The cyclist is lucky to have survived.	1	1		1																						195	14	221	8	0	0	4.758974358974359	13.928571428571429	53	24	11	10	5	22	110	8.0	9.04	7.24	30	7.5	8.84	7.571428571428571	10.5	291
4165	6561	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot, him not having anything to drink, nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages. In the essay it states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.” This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding enviroment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasen’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. “The cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one.	2	2		2																						184	8	198	6	0	0	4.309782608695652	23.0	44	32	9	8	7	21	104	14.2	7.85	8.42	23	11.7	13.58	13.5	9.3	241

In “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example about settings laffect people like cyclist. When you’re riding your bike as actually cross country transportation, you have to know what your doing and where you’re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route for a cyclist because at these “town” they had no water, because they weren’t towns to begin with, not anymore atleast. If you don’t have any water like this guy did hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example.” l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones help take your mind off thrist” This guy knew a little bit of survival tips. If he’d gone all that way without standing up yo his thrist and those hills, he probably would have had some kind of stroke. That is just a few way that setting could harm you.	3	3		3																						196	11	212	6	0	0	4.454081632653061	17.818181818181817	51	38	7	9	6	29	107	9.3	8.07	8.23	27	7.4	9.47	11.8	9.1	257
4169	6565	3	Some of the feature setting that effect the cyclist was the seal was begging to lent down, but he truly noticed it and about twenty miles up the road he came to park of sorts. The cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June. He get on his hands and hence working on the heated handle of the rusty pump. The pump began it shoot out a tarlike substance and the water was feeling somewhere of two hundred degrees. Two more miles I noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to a short, rolling hills.” He said tumble weeds crossed her path and a large snake crossed her pavement. He gather some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, after reading that if sucking of stones helps to be your mind off thirst. Well after reading of I believed these settings did effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																						149	8	159	3	0	0	4.369127516778524	18.625	37	23	8	4	6	12	82	9.8	7.66	7.98	18	8.1	8.79	10.2	5.3	190
4171	6567	3	In the story Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the features had a more negative affect on the cyclist. The cyclist got tired because of the big hills and he liked the scene which was they only good that if had on hon. “The water bottle only contained a few tantallizg sips.” he didnt have enough water and he was thirsty. “At some point a rediculously large  snak it really did look like dimond back–bloked the majority of the pavement.” It is dangerous where he was riding and even though he was on a bike he could have been bit. All of these points I made showed the negative affect.	1	1		1																						116	5	123	0	0	0	4.299145299145299	23.4	26	11	12	7	3	15	66	18.3	8.08	8.96	14	16.0	17.2	29.0	13.0	157
4180	6577	3	"The features of the setting have a large affect on the cyclist. If a cyclist would happen to be cycling in the snow, he or she could eat snow do keep from dehydration. If the cyclist in,”Do Not Exceed Posted  Speed Limit"", was cycling in winter time, he would of been so thirsty all of the time. Also if the whole ride was down hill, he would be so tired,"	1	1		1																						70	4	80	6	0	0	4.028169014084507	17.75	16	7	4	5	1	10	44	6.5	5.22	6.31	8	6.6	7.57	8.25	7.2	90
4190	6587	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie there were many settings that affect the cyclist. One example would be when he came up to a water pump and he tried to get water out but water didn’t come out. “…working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out….” (Kurmaskie). Another example is when he came across rolling hills, and the scaring heat, he also came across a snake that took up most of the pavement.	1	1		1																						93	6	104	2	0	0	4.2	15.833333333333334	27	15	3	1	4	14	49	10.4	7.26	8.02	12	8.8	10.18	12.875	9.5	122
4192	6589	3	The setting in the story was hot. The biker was sweating a lot. The whole town was empty. He pasted empty buildings. Their were rivers and big hills that he had to ride through. As it says about the buildings, “somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” The setting would affect the cyclist because their was no one in the town. Also, their was high hills.	1	1		1																						77	8	88	4	0	0	4.6103896103896105	9.625	19	10	6	5	2	12	44	5.8	7.35	7.46	10	4.0	4.92	4.785714285714286	6.2	101
4195	6592	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. “A rediculously large snake” this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.” I could drop from heat stroke” another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.” There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.” The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.” This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist.	3	2		3																						139	8	147	3	0	0	4.3428571428571425	17.5	36	14	11	7	7	18	83	22.3	8.43	8.43	14	17.8	19.67	28.0	11.9	182
4200	6597	3	In many real-life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest hindrance in succeeding, or even surviving. For example, the cyclist with stood the blozing heat of the sun as he pedaled through what seemed to be the @CAPS1’s living room: Dry, desolate, and extremely scornful. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS2 and depicts the intense heats of the desert. Another feature in the setting was the every hanging hills and steps though pedaling down the hills was an easier task, traveling up the hill, as well  as maneuvering the thirsts and bends served as a direct conflict. An example, “with what I believed was my last burst of energy I maneuvered a setting affect a situation is ultimately, the cyclist reached his destination is great relief. But the biggest hindrance was along his setting.	3	3		3																						157	6	177	10	0	0	4.772151898734177	26.333333333333332	45	20	12	5	9	24	81	16.9	10.34	9.92	36	14.4	16.64	20.0	14.3	232

All of the places that the author goes to make him even more determined because he wants to find water and he just wants to get to Yosemite.

This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him.

He reaches the first town which is a ghost town and it makes him sad. Riding on he begins to lose water. The once bright shiny day began to beat the heat down on the cyclist. He reached a ramshackle shed and began to lose hope. He loses water quickly and becomes more dehydrated. The terrain become slopes and hills and the ride become harder, when he reached the grape drink factory his hopes were almost gone. But just over the hill was a fishing shop.

4258	6655	3	The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men who’s information was not accurate. Then he cycled along the desert which was very hot. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way. He almost had a heat stroke a few times. He was probably angry that he took these men’s advice and got himself into this. Then when he found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So it’s really confusing because he probably felt relived and mad at the same time. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn’t, the old man would have gave him some more messed up direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke.	3	2		3																						174	10	189	5	0	0	4.126436781609195	17.4	28	18	20	17	6	18	113	6.7	5.86	6.5	15	6.5	9.03	7.142857142857142	9.9	222
4266	6663	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all, if the cyclist didn’t listen to the old man, he would have never gone through this trouble. Also being that he didn’t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own.	1	2		2																						87	6	96	3	0	0	4.137931034482759	14.5	13	13	8	9	3	10	54	5.3	5.5	6.53	4	4.2	6.26	6.416666666666667	5.5	108

I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.” This shows how he is doubtful.

4281	6678	3	The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? “ It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” The heat must have been bad, he wasn’t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men “helping” with directions.	2	2		2																						108	9	123	5	1	1	4.541284403669724	12.11111111111111	20	15	12	8	6	20	57	6.9	7.94	7.52	17	6.2	7.25	6.0	8.5	146
4283	6680	3	The features of the setting in the story “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting’s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story.	2	3		3																						192	9	218	15	0	0	4.583333333333333	21.333333333333332	53	22	14	5	5	32	107	12.1	8.77	8.61	34	10.3	11.89	11.2	10.7	264
4284	6681	3	The cyclit of “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was “@NUM1 degers”. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would’ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story.	2	2		2																						125	7	142	10	0	0	4.674603174603175	18.0	35	19	7	10	3	23	63	9.6	8.87	9.07	22	7.9	10.04	8.833333333333334	10.0	174
4289	6686	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill.

4290	6687	3	The setting from the story left the cyclist in a mental way because most of the time the sun was on his mind due to the fact that he was pedaling hard in a hot summer day in June. The cyclist had very little water and with him biking under a beating sun wasn’t exactly helping him. He  had to like disasterous events like, peddling slopes than the normal speed, a snake blocking the path, old men telling to take a different route then be infected, and the fact that his water supply was low made him think he was going to pass out under the burning sun. However his determination was strong as he continued on pedaling through and he eventually found himself in another town but this time with people, fish and water.	2	2		2																						135	4	145	5	0	0	4.294117647058823	34.0	32	21	10	6	5	12	73	15.8	7.96	7.77	16	14.1	15.59	18.333333333333332	12.6	187

Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, “This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration.

He said, “I hung my head” this shows how he almost completely lost all hope and that he was sure that he is going to die."	3	3		3																						139	6	148	1	0	0	4.100719424460432	23.166666666666668	32	23	8	3	2	18	78	15.3	6.63	7.98	14	12.1	15.36	18.0	9.5	170
4304	6701	3	During the cyclist’s biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town This sight doesn’t immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain. Eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief. As evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence.	3	2		3																						170	9	181	2	0	0	4.876470588235295	18.88888888888889	48	22	13	7	2	16	88	11.0	10.62	9.13	35	10.7	11.8	13.2	13.0	265

4310	6707	3	The harsh features at the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along “The high deserts of California in June”, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small “gost towns” rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as “Short rolling hills” through ghost the terrain and ever a snake. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey etc.	2	3		3																						134	6	141	1	0	0	4.865671641791045	22.333333333333332	38	19	9	5	4	13	66	12.7	10.91	9.57	28	10.8	12.5	11.6	11.5	197
4315	6712	3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness.	3	3		3																						141	11	161	9	0	0	4.333333333333333	12.818181818181818	33	20	12	9	6	20	79	5.4	6.13	7.97	24	4.7	7.67	6.25	8.8	189
4317	6714	3	The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as ‘the sun was beating down” and “high deserts of California in June” to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says “short rolling hills”, “tumbleweeds” and “long, crippling hill” to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower.  Finally, the cyclist is faced with a “rediculously large snake” and plants and weeds which get in his way and force him to slow down.	2	2		2																						105	4	113	3	0	0	4.811320754716981	26.5	26	17	13	3	8	17	49	18.9	11.04	9.28	16	14.6	17.05	14.75	13.0	148
4323	6720	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. They make it hard to concentrate, because its heat, they make it unbearable. The setting has the affect of drowsiness and thirst, “Dry bitter lnad, longing, longing.	1	1		1																						36	3	44	5	0	0	5.166666666666667	12.0	10	5	5	1	1	9	18	8.9	10.48	8.62	8	5.6	7.02	5.666666666666667	7.8	52
4324	6721	3	In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite. If the setting wouldn't have been so bad, the long ride wouldnt have been as hard on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a California desert, when he did find a well he said, “ followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. ” @CAPS1 thing about the setting is, if it wouldnt have been so hot, he wouldnt have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said “  I  could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. ” In conclusion, the setting played a major role in the story.	2	1		2																						145	7	169	10	0	0	4.190476190476191	21.0	30	14	11	10	1	19	90	13.0	7.09	7.14	15	11.1	12.7	13.25	9.4	194
4327	6724	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist by showing the rough conditions he went through, and somehow perservered through. The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the rolling hills. Followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This shows the struggle he went through and supports the setting story and how it affected his trip. This also shows how he perserverd through his struggles and made an effort to finish.	1	1		1																						88	5	95	4	0	0	5.034090909090909	17.6	21	18	3	4	5	12	46	13.3	11.31	9.21	18	9.5	10.16	12.0	8.8	123
4328	6725	3	The riders condition was rough, from flat land to rolling hills. This would be hard for some one who is dehydrating. There was a snake in his path so he went around it. This would be dangerous he could blackout from lack of water and then get bit by the snake.	1	1		1																						51	4	56	1	0	0	4.117647058823529	12.75	11	6	4	1	1	5	33	4.4	5.15	6.44	4	3.6	6.69	6.125	8.1	61

4338	6735	3	When riding a bike it @MONTH1 not seem to hard. For a cyclist every thing becomes more serious. The determination to win and be the best even if it kills you. In this essay he under estimates the dder cyclist. When really they are the people with more knowledge. Some of the things that @MONTH1 be hard for cyclist are the rough roads. Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke. As road get worse chances get higher tumble weeds and snakes in the way, he was determined to win. After all was said and he faced the horror that nature brought him he knew he was wrong wrong for them and the intelligants.	2	3		3																						154	12	167	1	0	0	4.311688311688312	12.833333333333334	35	22	13	9	6	15	90	5.3	6.25	6.94	16	4.7	6.68	5.222222222222222	7.8	206
4340	6737	3	Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride.	1	1		1																						69	4	73	0	0	0	4.231884057971015	17.25	15	8	4	4	2	5	45	7.1	6.61	7.47	7	6.5	8.66	8.625	8.8	89
4344	6741	3	Early in the morning, the cyclist is eager and ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older travelers. He hardly noticed the “sun was beginning to beat down.” He was calm and was looking forward to the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” Never once did he imagine what he had gotten himself into. As he began to approach the desert, he noticed he was running low on water. The strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect. The cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put pebbles into his mouth. He had once read, “that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” The cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across. Dehydration took it’s toll, and he felt hallucinations. He was beginning to lose hope. The heat and the hills and the lack of water had the greatest affect on the cyclist. Had he not been riding through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been fine.	3	2		3																						197	12	212	5	0	0	4.365482233502538	16.416666666666668	40	35	10	11	6	24	110	9.0	7.49	7.82	27	7.4	9.71	11.2	9.4	264
4350	6747	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse at minute from heat exaustion. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						103	4	112	5	0	0	4.495145631067961	25.75	28	9	3	4	2	11	62	12.6	8.54	7.52	15	11.0	13.04	14.25	10.7	145
4358	6755	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die … “(Kurmaskie).	3	2		3																						94	8	108	4	0	0	4.5473684210526315	11.875	18	19	6	6	7	15	56	6.1	7.29	7.08	12	5.5	6.85	5.625	8.1	132
4369	6766	3	The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was “going to drop from heat exsostion”, he is riding through the desert in @DATE1, and he took directions from three old “gentlemen” sitting on a porch.	1	1		1																						50	2	54	2	0	0	4.4	25.0	13	7	2	0	1	6	29	11.8	7.96	6.77	5	9.5	11.6	13.5	0.0	65
4371	6768	3	Well first off its very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily. And the hills are hard to get up so it would be a challange to get to the top.

4382	6779	3	The setting in  “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist. He was tacking through the “high desert of California in June”. June is a hot part of the year and since he was in the hottest desert part the hot was multiplied. The terrain changing into “short rolling hills” didn’t help the cyclist. The hills would make any riding more difficult. Anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement. With the person lack of water anyone would be struggling to keep riding on. Most people didn’t have that hints to keep moving. He didn’t set a very goal he just went to the “next Horizon”. Shouldn’t he just wanted to keep going. Another problem with the physical environment was the road conditions. When the “Rough Road Affect” sign appeared the travel then become more difficult. A bike tire take more effort to go over uneven pavement is why the cyclist had so much trouble.	3	3		3																						176	11	188	0	0	0	4.451977401129944	16.09090909090909	49	32	14	6	1	22	97	6.4	7.65	7.54	24	6.2	6.76	6.714285714285714	8.1	241
4383	6780	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way. With only a few sips of water left he said'' … abandoned years earlieR, by the looks of it it had been a @CAPS1 Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of Juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.'' When only having a few drops of water and seeing that would have increased my thirst more. Another way the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way was "" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. sometime ife can feel so cruel.'' This remind him that hes not in a car, and that hes not even going half the speed limit. The setting affects the cyclist by reminding him how long his journey is, and now at this point he is suffering."	3	2		3																						164	10	185	3	0	0	4.163636363636364	16.5	45	23	8	9	4	19	87	7.5	6.03	7.63	19	6.8	8.96	8.5	9.2	220
4389	6786	3	The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the “ghost town” early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned welch’s Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, “It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1, his suffering was through when he discovered a “fish camp,” with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist’s relief was so immense that he,” had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them.	1	1		1																						191	8	214	13	0	0	4.539267015706806	23.875	49	23	19	12	6	32	99	11.9	8.54	8.87	31	10.3	11.65	11.8	10.7	261
4392	6789	3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town he’s tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he’s tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He’s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is greatful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story the cyclists needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relived.	2	3		3																						140	7	149	3	0	0	4.171428571428572	20.0	26	19	12	8	7	9	82	9.9	6.85	6.71	12	7.7	10.75	11.2	10.1	174
4395	6792	3	The setting affect the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay. The mood of the essay I think is a sort of dry summer day, the sort of “oh my gosh, its really hot,” type thing. The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, tumble weeds and more to contribut to the hopeless feeling. Although he was secured, and didn’t die, it seemed like he would surely not make it judging by the lack of water, scorching hot sun, and distance, with enduring these conditions. So the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him.	2	2		2																						112	5	126	10	0	0	4.348214285714286	22.4	33	15	6	3	4	18	58	10.3	7.43	8.27	16	8.5	10.39	14.0	9.4	149
4403	6800	3	"The setting acts as a catylist in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is always challenging the character untill the very end. In the story it says “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says “The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.” This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him it also shows how is risle he is, and how satiricle life can be. The ultimate @CAPS1 in this story is when he stumbels across the welches grape juice factory and there was a piture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” No matter where the cycalist goes he is alway trying to overcome the elements."	2	3		3																						146	9	158	2	0	0	4.219178082191781	16.22222222222222	36	17	8	9	2	22	84	7.6	6.62	8.22	25	8.1	9.79	7.0	9.8	198
4409	6806	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when the author says “flat roads were replace by short rolling hills”, that made the author have to ride safer. Also, when he says,” the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.” The author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past. Finally when the author says “no one in sight”, no building, car, or structure”, he is affected because he can’t ask questions since hes lost and hes thirsty. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go.	1	2		2																						114	6	127	7	0	0	4.359649122807017	19.0	26	22	8	4	4	16	63	10.5	7.67	7.95	11	8.6	10.87	11.2	9.9	146
4411	6808	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined.	1	1		1																						128	8	139	3	0	0	4.515625	16.0	28	24	8	7	4	13	67	7.9	8.06	7.64	20	7.2	8.59	7.0	9.2	174
4412	6809	3	In the story, the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1’s Fish camp, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclist’s attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not.	3	3		3																						145	8	164	11	0	0	4.63448275862069	18.125	28	16	16	9	6	20	83	9.4	8.52	8.02	23	8.0	8.9	8.333333333333334	10.4	202
4420	6817	3	The effects from the setting that has an effected on me is that while riding on the bike in hot weather with only a little bit of water to drink because I would have giving up have nothing to drink.

4456	6853	3	When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty. There was eventually nothing. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, “a large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved.	3	2		3																						156	11	172	2	0	0	4.333333333333333	14.181818181818182	31	28	12	9	5	22	87	6.1	6.55	6.87	14	5.3	6.71	5.75	7.3	199

There was also lots of hills that took his strength to jump for example it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" There was also a big crazy twist in his way. He even saw a snake. All of these things made him really tired for example he didn't have much water and the sun was making him hot and dehydrated. There was no shade so he had to just take the sun beating down on his back. He had to jump over hills so that took alot of energy. He had to ride up one long hill so that also made him tired. All of these things happened back to back without giving him a break, so it really tired him out."	2	2		2																						171	9	186	3	0	0	3.8771929824561404	19.0	31	28	11	13	3	12	117	6.3	4.7	6.15	9	6.0	8.54	11.0	8.5	207

It says this when the characters says. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.

4473	6870	3	Hot, alone, no water – all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is very hot as the cyclist is riding. This makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated. The cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight. If anything happened to him there is no one to help. The cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy. With very little water it is hard to stay hydrated. Hot, alone, no water- all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																						101	8	113	4	0	0	4.346534653465347	12.625	22	15	8	8	3	11	60	5.4	6.31	6.14	11	5.8	6.23	5.625	6.6	137

The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped.

The first and most obvious is the temperature, it is hot, therefore the rider is hot and becoming dehydrated making him thirsty. A second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him. Since nothing is around him there is no where for him to get water adding to the affect of dehydration making him more thiristy. The rider says “One ran shacle shed, sevral rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn’t hold the lamestmal egreeted me. ''This statement from the author support the factt that nothing is around. Onemore feature of the setting that affected the rider was the hills.

4492	6889	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affected the cyclist in the story. “Not two miles into this next reaction of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (kurmaskie). the cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy, than flat riding. This energy, loss coupled with the cyclist lack of water causes him to become even more miserable.

4497	6894	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist, on his way to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the rough deserts of California. As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, as is the sand. There is no water anywhere and dangerous, highly venomous creatures are abundant. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grope juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere.

Each more mile he keeps telling himself, if I can just get there I’ll be fine. He also blames himself for listening to the old men. And with this also came doubt.

The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist	2	3		3																						138	9	153	9	0	0	4.782608695652174	15.333333333333334	29	21	14	8	1	21	74	10.9	9.69	7.59	18	8.6	10.49	11.6	10.9	192

He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more.” I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldn’t find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit”, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																						180	8	203	14	0	0	4.344444444444444	22.5	39	29	14	11	10	28	97	10.3	7.43	7.82	21	8.5	10.56	13.75	9.5	233
4567	6965	3	The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time. Destined to reach yosemite national park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening strongly. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture. next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted”. With what I believed to be my last burst of enery, I manevuered down the hill”. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replerilshed with confidence he had before when he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile”	3	2		3																						161	8	177	10	0	0	4.795031055900621	20.125	39	27	13	9	3	22	82	11.2	9.86	8.56	31	8.8	11.77	12.2	11.0	230
4568	6966	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned.

4570	6968	3	The author’s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist’s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he’s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person’s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.	3	2		3																						175	10	188	3	0	0	4.64	17.5	45	26	19	3	3	16	89	9.2	8.93	7.3	17	7.8	8.83	8.5	9.4	241
4571	6969	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. Fem the ghost town to the bait shop, it was all a challenge for him. A misleading challenge , But a challenge . In the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself. From staring at the horizon to get to a place to another from sucking on pebble stone to not focus on water. And when he arrive at the bait shop. A sense of relief came to him, like that shop was his safe haven. But yet he would never get directions from any old-timer again. Lack was not a factor in this story. Rather it was drive and overal climate of the story. When it was two –hundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light. And also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it.	2	2		2																						151	12	168	5	0	0	4.099337748344371	12.583333333333334	34	18	7	6	7	16	92	4.3	5.21	6.9	18	4.6	6.03	5.875	7.2	193
4574	6972	3	Almost all the features of the settin affect the cyclist. For instence the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is. “The water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips. Wid rings of sweet circled my shirt.” These description suggests that he is very hot since he is sweety and hes been drinking so much. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town. “I began breaking the ride down into distress I could make it test for.” He is making the ride seem like a lot of short rides so he could make it.	2	2		2																						133	9	141	0	0	0	4.052631578947368	14.777777777777779	30	22	7	7	3	13	77	10.9	6.1	7.92	16	10.1	11.54	10.8	8.2	167
4585	6983	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough, uneven and he has to push out more energy to pedal his bike on rough, uneven roads then on nice, paved, even roads and also he is out of water so there again is using all his energy without any redaveanator.	1	1		1																						54	1	59	4	0	0	4.2592592592592595	54.0	11	5	7	4	2	4	34	25.6	7.79	9.53	8	22.0	23.08	30.0	0.0	73
4590	6988	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist is affected by the setting mently and physicly. For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don’t think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way	2	2		2																						163	8	171	1	0	0	4.245398773006135	20.375	30	27	6	9	7	15	95	10.2	7.26	7.02	15	8.8	11.04	11.2	9.6	213
4592	6990	3	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such a empty terran that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strenght to go on and get to safty.	1	1		1																						77	3	81	1	0	0	3.8181818181818183	25.666666666666668	14	12	3	2	4	4	56	9.4	4.88	7.17	7	9.8	10.8	13.5	7.8	97
4596	6994	3	In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated “I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1”. Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages “A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen.	1	1		1																						73	3	75	0	0	0	4.602739726027397	24.333333333333332	18	10	2	6	1	6	40	12.4	9.41	8.3	16	11.6	13.01	14.833333333333334	12.5	109
4599	6997	3	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist’s mood and energy. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself.	2	2		2																						83	6	93	5	0	0	4.63855421686747	13.833333333333334	23	10	8	4	5	15	41	8.7	8.47	8.65	13	7.4	10.5	10.1	10.8	119
4601	6999	3	All the features of the settings affect his rythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can.

4606	7004	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way.	2	1		2																						83	8	98	7	0	0	4.795180722891566	10.375	26	14	4	5	1	14	45	6.4	7.98	7.58	14	5.0	7.05	5.0625	8.5	119

This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by @LOCATION2 standards, where it gets to @NUM1 degrees, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at @NUM2. By noon, it's past @NUM3. Also, the author comes to a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 he makes note that he’s only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last ""tentalizing sips,"" This is his main problem, his lack of water.

4616	7014	3	The setting of “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of louage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there. “I got down on my hands, and knees, working,the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength.

4618	7016	3	"The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because it’s a dry area in California in June.

4621	7019	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man’s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	1	2		2																						86	6	91	0	0	0	4.3023255813953485	14.333333333333334	17	10	6	1	6	7	52	6.0	6.72	6.55	9	6.5	8.05	7.666666666666666	10.1	118
4633	7031	3	The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectaculiar and amazing like. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasn’t what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story.	1	1		1																						139	6	147	2	0	0	3.9280575539568345	23.166666666666668	15	31	3	8	9	10	87	14.5	5.76	7.86	13	13.3	14.78	13.75	9.5	175
4635	7033	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the @LOCATION1, where it’s nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. He’s excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch’s Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again.	2	3		3																						142	9	161	10	0	0	4.190140845070423	15.777777777777779	30	20	16	10	8	21	80	6.2	5.91	7.87	19	5.9	7.17	7.0	8.2	183
4638	7036	3	During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasn’t even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low. Then , what is originally a sign of hope because another let down. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach “rough roads” creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait “tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more.	3	3		3																						221	14	249	13	0	0	4.755656108597285	15.785714285714286	50	35	21	16	8	30	118	8.9	9.39	7.29	28	7.1	8.64	7.142857142857142	9.8	312

This adaodoness makes it hard for the cycleist to frot hope and threes as where to get water. “I could drop from a heat strote in a gorgeous day in June, hes in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around no one this make's him very desperate since hes adaodoned.	1	2		2																						68	2	77	4	0	0	4.205882352941177	34.0	23	5	4	1	2	14	41	15.4	6.92	8.34	5	11.8	14.78	18.0	0.0	79
4644	7042	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people, and cars on his “shortcut” he was in great doubt of his survival. “I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.” He thought he wouldn’t get any water because there was nothing around him and he thought he would die of dehydration or heatstroke. “And the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke.”	2	2		2																						75	4	80	3	0	0	4.466666666666667	18.75	19	11	2	1	4	11	44	37.1	9.25	10.73	10	29.0	31.6	40.5	0.0	98
4647	7045	3	In this paragraph I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, & animals.

4655	7053	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, “A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didn’t have much to drink until the next town. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills” (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen” (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted.	3	2		3																						169	11	202	13	0	0	4.670588235294118	15.454545454545455	49	18	25	11	4	37	77	10.0	8.7	8.21	24	8.3	10.12	8.333333333333334	10.3	231
4656	7054	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn’t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn’t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn’t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn’t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn’t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don’t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better.	3	2		3																						221	7	233	5	0	0	4.153846153846154	31.571428571428573	36	40	16	17	11	16	140	13.9	7.09	7.06	12	12.1	13.0	12.5	7.4	285
4657	7055	3	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that he is going up this big hill its hot, there snakes, hes scared and tired. Almost all of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop he is determined to go up this hill. He also knows that it cant be that bad because he can just relax al the way back down.	1	1		1																						81	6	91	2	0	0	3.8395061728395063	13.5	10	11	9	9	1	7	56	3.4	3.82	7.04	6	3.8	6.39	6.416666666666667	7.8	98
4659	7057	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power.	2	2		2																						160	10	174	3	0	0	4.3602484472049685	16.1	30	27	3	10	7	13	107	8.1	7.36	6.0	11	7.9	8.62	6.571428571428571	9.7	217
4667	7065	3	The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , “like a foolish yuuth,” folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He –ans almost dehydrated and “in an ironic twist” he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we’re your best bet “ in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who “haven’t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office”	3	3		3																						144	6	161	8	0	0	4.427586206896552	24.166666666666668	39	22	11	4	4	27	67	11.6	8.42	9.23	19	9.0	10.64	8.166666666666666	8.3	185
4669	7067	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer and more difficult and dangerous way to go. He takes the awee of going that way by some old folks that he says “haven’t gotten off there porches since carter was in office.” I think tha tthere would be a reason to not listen to them though they @MONTH1 have wisdom.	1	1		1																						70	3	72	0	0	0	4.314285714285714	23.333333333333332	17	10	5	4	2	6	38	16.4	8.02	9.66	9	13.4	15.71	19.5	0.0	90
4676	7074	3	The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because, he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehygrated it's not healthy and you die from it. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down,along with the sweat.

Also he takes advise from old men and he meets up with an @CAPS1 Snake and he goes down an dirt Road he has no water at the time there.

4710	7108	3	The cyclist is affected by the heat, the hills, and the lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing short on water and had “wide rings of dried sweat on his on shirt,” and he could “drop from heatstroke.” The hills must have forced him to use more energy, and lasely  the land of people.

First is the ‘shorecay’ that is suggested to get    to @CAPS1, which naturally just ends up separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water. His water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die. In the story, he says: ‘It really didn’t matter. I was going to die and the lards would pick me clean.’ This shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless.	2	2		2																						123	6	134	4	0	0	4.362903225806452	20.666666666666668	26	21	6	7	4	16	70	11.5	7.84	8.32	19	10.5	11.79	14.25	9.9	172

A second obstacle was having to make sure the Empire State Building could withstand the stress created by the blimp. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The difficulty with this obstacle was having to refurbish the steel frame at the Empire State Building which took lots of time, work, and over sixty thousand dollars.

The winds at this height are shifting to frequently causing the dirigible to be tossed around the mast, making it unsafe to board. Another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below. The third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building.

Al @CAPS1 competitive nature not only pushed the building to a un-precedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, And effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blowup over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigable plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through.

They also didn't think about the @CAPS1 that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very Flammable and if one was to ascend in @CAPS2, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people bellow would be doomed.More problems the architects face were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around.

It prohibited the flying of any air travel bellow a certain Feet in residential areas.	2	4		3																						187	9	215	13	0	0	4.821052631578947	21.11111111111111	54	20	15	14	5	24	106	17.2	10.8	9.49	38	13.1	15.26	14.25	12.2	267

9092	15042	6	The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was laden with problems ranging from natural preventions to pre-existing laws. During the time of frequent dirigible travel in the world, a German dirigible called the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey due to a complication with fire. This catastrophe revealed to the workers a problem they had previously overlooked, the fact that most foreign dirigibles were inflated with flamable hydrogen gas. The idea of a problem like the Hindenburg ocuring over one of the most densely populated cities in the world ruled out the idea. The workers of this project also overlooked the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Although the empire state building was anticipated to be the tallest building in the world, the soon to be created mast would still be too close to the millions of people in the city. After test runs had occured to try out the new mooring system it was seen that dirigibles were not even able to get close enough to the mast due to the strong winds. The idea that these same winds would blow the dirigible into another buildings spire put fear into the minds of the people. The combination of this variety of problems put an end to the idea of using a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building	4	4		4																						227	9	240	3	0	0	4.726872246696035	25.22222222222222	68	26	17	11	0	15	118	13.5	10.1	8.85	44	11.9	13.08	16.5	12.3	331

The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents.

Another obsticle faced by the builders was that most countries other than the United States use hydrogen instead of helium to make there dirigible fly. Hydrogen was very flammable and builders figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a desely populated area like New York, it would be devastating. The greatest obsticle faced by the builders were the wind on top of the building that was constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currats. While the digarble were tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles.

If there was the smallest spark the entire Dirigible would go up in flames in a second. For an example The hindenburg German zeppelin that exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937.

In the end the mooring mast never was made because of safety, unpredictable nature and of the law itself. It was unsafe due to the highly flammable dirigibles putting the high populated region in danger. The winds would shift to constantly and violently and be to very difficult to control the dirigible. Also, the law that airships flying too low over urban areas would have made it illegal. Ships would not be able to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Overall, there were too many obstacles that made it impossible for the engineers to build a mooring mast.	3	4		4																						197	10	213	4	0	0	4.690355329949239	19.7	45	22	19	14	5	15	113	10.5	9.46	7.9	31	8.6	10.52	11.6	11.0	279

If the mass interfered with the frame of the building, then changing the material of the building could cost ""over sixty thousand dollars!"" In addition, safety was a major component when trying to construct the mooring mast. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen...and hydrogen is highly flammable."" New York is a very populated area, which means when building a mooring mast, safety must be considered into perspective. Lastly, their were restrictions on airships flying too close to cities. As it states in the excerpt, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

9262	15212	6	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced are dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it was ignited it was cause a lot of property damage. Also at 1,250 ft there is a lot of wind. The dirigible would blow around the building causing unnatural stress to the building. It would be very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	1	2		2																						75	5	80	1	0	0	4.56	15.0	23	10	3	3	1	6	38	7.5	8.11	8.17	11	8.0	10.27	8.5	11.2	110

This caused the Hindenburg a German made vessel to burst into flames in New Jersey, and when this happened the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happend in the densly populated New York City. Also this was a question of safty because the winds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible all around.

9277	15227	6	And the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous challenges in order to add the mast to the building. They needed to consult with experts and learn all they could about how dirigibles themselves worked. It took engineers in New York and government workers all the way in Washington to piece together a plan on how to make it work. Just adding the mast would never work. Keeping it tethered by one cable would add a ton of stress to the framework, so all of the steel frame needed to be strengthened. Making the mast appealing to look at to took resources. Ultimately though, all the plans fell through. Nature had been the biggest problem. When currents are violent up in the air around the mast, which would cause the blimp the swing around dangerously. Had a ship crashed, hundreds of people in the urban New York would be crushed. The project had to be scrapped, with the mast becoming a purely decorative addition.	3	3		3																						165	11	181	5	0	0	4.642424242424243	15.0	43	28	5	9	3	15	89	7.9	8.52	8.4	30	5.6	8.42	8.5	9.3	222
9280	15230	6	Not everyone can invent new ways of transportation for the future. Al Smith learned that the hard way when he hired a team of builders to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team ran into numerous obstacles that caused problems and derailed there progress. One problem that arised was that the weight of the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame, which was only reenforced by steel. Another issue was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. The most important problem was nature. Wind made maneuvering difficult, and violent current could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban, populated areas. Although the idea of the Empire State Building being used as an airdock was innovative, it was not practical or well thought out.	4	3		4																						150	10	166	5	0	0	5.08	15.0	46	15	13	8	4	17	75	10.0	11.01	9.33	35	8.0	10.27	7.7142857142857135	11.2	229

New York City is full of buildings and there is not a lot a flat ground to land a dirigible. The builders second obstacle was that they couldn't find a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. The builders would need to make a stronger building frame so the mast could safely be on the top of the building without adding stress to the frame. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. The wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and strong at times. The back of the dirigible would move from the wind, even if it was tied to the building. The last reason was that there was a law that wouldn't allow the dirigibles to fly that low over an urban area.

Then came the necessary modifications needed to improve upon the buildings framework to support the zepplins weight putting stress on the building after being pushed around by winds 1, 250 ft above the ground.  Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zepplins over heavily crowded areas was safety.  The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out.  For example, some of those zepplins use hydrogen to stay a loft, and if a hydrogen filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty immenent people below would be harmed.

That's what the Empire State building faced during its contraction.	0	1		1																						91	6	100	1	0	0	4.384615384615385	15.166666666666666	22	16	3	4	2	8	55	6.8	6.89	7.34	12	6.9	8.28	7.416666666666666	8.3	124

9361	15311	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on the top. If they did, the whole building's foundation would have to be changed. Nature was also a major reason to stop the project. The wind currant were always changing and the blimp would swirl around. Safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be over New York was to burst into flames many people would be killed. In conclusion, these obstacles are why the builder stopped and didn't complete the project for the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																						117	8	130	3	0	0	4.683760683760684	14.625	34	16	5	4	3	11	69	7.9	8.63	7.73	15	5.4	7.89	7.0	8.5	154

9372	15322	6	The excerpt of The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted reveals that the architects of the Empire State faced a number of obstacles. Not only was the construction of the building now competive, but its expectations were unrealistic. The idea for such a masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects not very competitive. As the work-in-progress of the Chrysler building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested and addition of a mooring mast, to not only make the building the tallest, but to add to its purpose. The addition of a mooring mast would require a lot of planning, though. If a giant steel framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as is, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building, so the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger. Also, the architects didn't realized the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and proved a threat to the thousands of people living below.	2	2		2																						187	9	214	13	0	0	4.887700534759358	20.77777777777778	57	20	10	10	5	24	105	12.0	10.27	8.55	31	10.2	11.53	12.6	11.9	276
9377	15327	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there @CAPS1 was the actual design of the mooring and modifications that would have to be made to the building. Due to the stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible, structure of the building had to be made stronger. The mast would also have to withstand holding down the dirigible just one cable tether, which would put a lot of stress on the mast and building. Another issue faced by the builders was the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States most the used hydrogen, not helium, in the balloon, which made it more flammable and dangerous. If one ever caught on fire above New York City, it would be disastrous. Finally, there was already a law in place that airships could not fly to low over urban areas. This law made it so that it was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to, or even approach the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, most too great to overcome. When it came to trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the spire of the building.	4	3		4																						212	9	231	10	0	0	4.523584905660377	23.555555555555557	56	29	12	12	5	17	125	11.6	8.71	7.49	29	10.1	11.52	14.75	11.2	291
9379	15329	6	While planning this architectural masterpiece, builders faced many obstacles. This plan to have a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building definitely did not fulfill expectations. The first big problem was the large amounts of stress to the framework of the building when the zepplins would be moored to the top, also the amount of pull would impact the foundation as well. The second problem was the cost to modify the skyscraper to meet the needs to not stress the framework. Safety was a huge issue as well; most blimps are filled with hydrogen which is a highly flammable gas, also if it were to explode it is floating over one of the largest cities in the country. With New @CAPS1 geographical positioning the wind is very strong off the ocean, these violent air currents constantly shift directions which could cause the zepplin to crash into the building. The final obstacle was the law against airships, they could not fly to low over highly populated urban cities.	4	3		4																						170	7	183	5	0	0	4.8	24.285714285714285	47	16	16	12	0	16	93	13.3	10.39	9.11	34	10.4	13.25	11.6	11.5	238
9388	15338	6	The wind was a huge issue when building the empire state building. The building was so high off the ground that the top was not as stable. If they used dirigibles on the Empire State building it would be dangerous because the weights would be dangling high in the air over all of the pedestrians heads. That plan was not smart or safe. The purpose to build it higher was just so it could be the tallest building, there was really no good reasons for it.	1	2		2																						86	5	92	1	0	0	4.27906976744186	17.2	20	5	8	6	1	6	54	7.3	6.84	6.51	8	6.5	7.81	8.4	8.2	109

Modifications to the building would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Other problems the building faced had to do with safety. Some dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable and if an accident were to happen in New York it would be disastrous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting and even tethered to the mooring mast, the ship would not be secured. This was also very unsafe.

One obstacle of the builders was creating the Empire State Building with the strength to hold the dirigible, swaying in the wind, without the building falling over. The weight of the dirigible would have to be transferred to the bottom of the building which was almost eleven hundred feet below. The largest obstacle, however, was holding the dirigible in place while it was docked atop the building. The winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and would make the dirigible fly wildly around the top of the building (@CAPS1 paragraph @NUM1).

9403	15353	6	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to use the building to make New York the leader in modern travel. They built a mooring mast which they planned to use to dock dirigibles. Unfortunately, there were some unexpected difficulties and this goal was never accomplished.When the architects first decided to add the mast to the Empire State Building, they realized that they would have to redesign the entire building's support structure because of the pressure that a docked dirigible would put on the building. Even after this problem was solved, there were numerous obsticles keeping the goal from being reached.The architects had failed to see many of the potential problems with the mast. Not until after the mast was built did they realized that most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium to stay afloat. Hydrogen, being highly flammable was not a risk that the builders wanted to take over the densely populated city. The architects also realized that the unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast would be too dangerous to dock a dirigible.Once these obsticles appeared, it became evident that the Empire State Building would never dock a dirigible.	3	3		3																						197	10	216	5	0	0	5.02	20.0	50	32	14	12	1	17	112	16.7	12.07	8.8	34	13.1	14.69	15.25	14.3	298
9406	15356	6	When attempting to add a mooring mask to the Empire State Building, the people who were adding it faced several impediments. Right away, the builders took the size of a dirigible into account. If there were something that large at the top of the building, the frame would be warped. To solve this problem, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars to change the original framework, to a more suitable one. Another obsticle faced by the builders of the mast, was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a drigible attempting to dock. Also, they realized that the mast was above a large urban area, so if there would be an accident, bad situations would take place. There was also a law about aircraft traveling too low over a City. The drigible mooring dock atop the Empire State Building was not meant to be.	3	3		3																						150	8	167	9	0	0	4.586666666666667	18.75	35	20	11	7	1	18	86	9.6	8.65	7.2	17	8.3	9.92	11.8	10.7	204
9409	15359	6	There were a few obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible is a blimp, giant steel balloons that are filled with hydrogen and helium. Dirigibles had a lack of suitable landing area in New York. Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York. He came up with the idea that a mooring mast being added to the Empire State building would allow dirigibles to anchor there, fuel up and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible. The architects and builders had to consult with experts so they took workers at the @ORGANIZATION2, tested the mass and met with president of a recently formed airship transport company.

They realized that the safety of the people has to come first in all scenarios. Also, another obstacle that Al Smith and the builders faced was docking the dirigible when people are down below.

As a solution to this issue, Al Smith, the four term governor of New York, put a ""quick fix"" in place. Smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the buildings support.

9482	15432	6	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 is a story that takes the reader through the obstacles and attempts builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, four-term governor of New York, planned to construct the Empire State Building after he was in office.Smith was competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the title of world's tallest building. So in 1929 he announced that the building would be 1,250 feet and he would do this by adding a top or hat to the building which would be distinctive. The idea was to add a mooring mass and observation decks to the top and have it be able to dock dirigibles, or blimps. Architects later realized that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by one cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of a dirigible's load with the pressure of wind would go all the way to the building's foundation. The plans that have builders working so hard on frame work and observation decks failed. It was not practical to dock a dirigible, it wouldn't be safe. By the late 1930s, the idea was given up on, but the Empire State Building is still open to one of the observation decks and is a very popular attraction in New York."	2	1		2																						232	10	260	7	0	0	4.55793991416309	23.3	75	24	12	7	10	22	131	13.0	8.88	8.32	29	11.0	12.91	19.0	12.1	320

It's original property was not to be a mooring mast. The empire state building had to be refraimed then the government banned aircraft too low then commercial airliners took over the avaiting industry. It was too dangerious for dirigibles to dock because the strong currents can blow them out of place causing accidents similar to the hindinburg.	1	2		2																						88	5	94	0	0	0	4.988636363636363	17.6	24	13	7	4	0	10	47	10.9	10.9	9.17	22	9.0	12.49	11.4	12.3	132

The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome."	4	4		3																						283	14	321	8	0	0	4.985865724381625	20.214285714285715	79	31	21	15	5	29	161	12.2	10.79	7.93	45	10.0	10.91	12.6	12.3	417

""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was a concern for safety. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophe if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937...""These obstacles were not just ones that the builders could ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use altogether."	3	3		3																						191	10	219	13	0	0	4.948186528497409	19.3	56	22	15	13	5	25	104	15.8	11.15	8.88	37	12.8	14.06	14.75	13.7	283

The dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor. Dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles.

9580	15530	6	Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and @CAPS1 dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast.             It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians.       Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about @MONEY1 to fix.            Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. @CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used.             Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could because by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way.	4	4		4																						301	19	346	17	0	0	5.245901639344262	16.05263157894737	84	35	26	17	9	42	157	13.7	11.95	8.58	60	12.9	12.32	10.666666666666666	13.6	519

From the reading excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted stated that dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, tha't four blocks in New York City.

Architects also had to find a way to redesign the building so that it support the weight of the dirigible. The biggest obstecle, they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and although it would be tied down to the building the back of it would still be swirling, they didn't have a way to fix that, because usually dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in an open field and it would be to risky to do that over a populated area.	2	3		3																						171	7	186	6	0	0	4.5964912280701755	24.428571428571427	43	24	9	8	2	15	101	12.5	9.12	8.63	29	10.4	12.33	11.4	10.9	233

The used of hydrogen rather than helium because hydrogen is highly flammable. The obstacles of it was nature itself. There's always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building. So it makes it possible for the dirigible to swivel around which is dangerous. Dirigibles moored in the open landing fields could be weighed down but, using these at the Empire State Building can dangling high above pedestrians which is not safe. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If the dirigible blows the sharp spires of the building can puncture the dirigible's shell.

(paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 a hydrogen filled dirigible to float above densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been to dangerous of a risk. In 1937 a hydrogen blimp did catch fire, and the outcome was disastrous; owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have been much worse. In higher altitudes winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to spend about. Normally the tail end would be weighted down, but weights hanging above the city isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempt: at docking of the building the winds were too fierce for the dirigible to even get close to the building. The capitan of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2) and that could put a hole in the blimp. Lastly, a law in New York City states that airships can't fly below a specific altitude, thus making the docking of a dirigible on top of the Empire State illegal.

Also, wind on top of the building was out of there control, and with the violent wind currents, docking would be highly dangerous.

Although it would be possible to strap lead weights to the back end of the blimp, it would be unpractical and highly dangerous to the public. Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building even if the docking station was completed because of an existing law that forbids airships flying too low over urban areas.

9762	15712	6	There were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast.	3	4		4																						136	9	149	4	0	0	4.654411764705882	15.11111111111111	34	13	15	7	3	11	75	8.0	8.58	7.75	23	6.8	9.28	7.571428571428571	10.5	195

For example the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof.

One obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building with a tether, then the back would be free to swing and sway. Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flamable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazzard about New York City. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly dirigibles to low over urban areas. These are the reasons why the idea of a dock for dirigibles could never work out.	3	3		3																						146	7	156	3	0	0	4.465753424657534	20.857142857142858	38	19	9	4	2	11	86	10.1	8.24	7.7	24	9.1	11.65	12.8	12.8	210

The building wasn't strong enough. If they had tied a dirigible to the top of the original Empire state bilding, it would have pulled the building untill it feel over. The architects had to upgrade the frame so it was safe. Now that the frame was safe they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast the other end would blow in the wind. This would make unloding cargo and people very hard. Also dirigibles could catch fire, which wasn't safe. for the people on the ground.

The dirigible were enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric. filled with hydrogen and helium to make it lighter than air. unlike the balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. like a gandala. Another obstacle is the sucessful use of the mooring mast. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. It could also weight down and dangle above the pedestrians wasn't safe.

The first obstacle was ""nature itself"", meaning that the air currents at the top of the Empire State building were so powerful that the wind was constantly changing directions. This meant that if a dirigible could somehow fly through the winds and could be tied to the mast it would ""swivel around and around"" and would end up ""dangling over pedestrians"" which ""was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, A dirigible is not leagally allowed to dock at the mooring mast because it would be ""flying too low over urban areas"" Which there is an ""existing law"" against. This is a problem for the builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they would not be leagally allowed to dock dirigibles at the Mooring Mast. Lastly, many dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a feul. Hydrogen gas is ""highly flammable"" and a dirigible using hydrogen gas is therefore also highly flammable and could potentially pose a disaster to the ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Because of potential fires, city laws, and air currents, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles when they tried to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast"	4	3		4																						227	8	257	7	0	0	4.889867841409692	28.375	59	31	14	18	8	27	121	17.8	10.86	8.51	35	14.7	15.78	20.666666666666668	14.6	335

10017	15967	6	The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest and hard obstacle to over come is saftey for everyone. The builders had to worry about the safty of the people coming in and out of the dirigible, the people on the near by streets and to the people in the side of the building. Saftey was one of the main reasons why the dock never was completed.Another huge obstacle that faced the builders was nature. This is true because winds at the top of the tall buildings were always changing and this would make it hard to land the dirigible on it. Like the excerpt states in paragraph @NUM1, Dirigibles were weighted down in the back by lead weights and this would cause a problem with pedestrians walking under in the streets.	2	3		2																						144	7	154	2	0	0	4.524137931034483	20.714285714285715	37	16	10	5	5	9	87	12.0	9.06	7.79	18	10.3	11.54	11.8	11.2	196

Although this was a great idea there were many issues that the constructor did not see, This is because the thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The wind would also add thousands of dollars in damage, to ensure that no damage or harm would be put on the building or residents of New York the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened.

This obstacle was nature itself. violent air currents would have the back of the blimps swivel around and around the mast. The blimp would need weights to hold it steady, but these weights would be hanging over people on the street and this was neither practical nor safe.	2	3		3																						144	7	156	4	0	0	4.9375	20.571428571428573	43	19	9	2	6	9	80	13.8	11.15	8.12	23	10.3	12.66	12.4	11.9	203

10056	16006	6	In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak.The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put @MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building.An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives.I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still use the mooring mast today.	2	3		3																						176	10	195	4	0	0	4.4972067039106145	17.9	64	15	11	3	2	17	94	12.7	8.94	7.57	18	9.5	11.63	11.2	10.3	235
10057	16007	6	Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for ship to even go near the building. But say a ship got tethered to the mooring mast, the back end of the ship would swivel around the mass due to constant shifting winds because of violent air currents. Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights. This was dangerous for many reasons but mainly because the weights would be hanging over downtown New York. Without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell. With the wind pressure and the dirigibles load itself there would be too much stress being added to the buildings frame. The buildings steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have to be made so the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most of the dirigibles that were made out of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is more flamable so the owners of the Empire state building realized how worse the accident could have been if it were over downtown New York. With all of these obsticles in their way the owners and builders of the Empire state building voted to postpone the installation of the landing gear.	4	4		4																						269	12	284	3	0	0	4.710037174721189	22.416666666666668	74	29	23	10	4	15	151	12.0	9.99	7.86	41	9.7	11.34	11.8	11.2	374

The mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful for tourist attraction.	3	2		3																						118	5	125	1	0	0	4.796610169491525	23.6	37	11	10	6	4	7	59	13.0	10.51	9.09	23	11.3	12.83	16.0	13.3	178

There were obstacles such as the fact that if a dirigible were tied to the building by a single tether it would ""add stress to the building's frame."" To fix the problem, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building. Another problem was that some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable which would be very dangerous to have over a densely populated area. The ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" By this, Lüsted means that there are many violent air currents at the top of the building, meaning that the ship would swivel around and around. To make sure this would not happen, lead wieghts would have to be used which would not be practical or safe to have ""dangling high above pedestrians."" In the end, people realized there were far too many problems involved in the use of a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State building."	3	3		3																						195	9	220	6	0	0	4.753846153846154	21.666666666666668	51	25	15	10	2	22	117	11.8	9.52	7.87	32	9.4	11.76	12.8	11.6	276
10143	16093	6	The experts faced a few major obstacles in the building of the Empire State building.  One of those major obstacles was the frame work.  When your going to build a 1,250 foot building and have a air craft land on it, you need a good and well designed frame.  What they did was add a stainless steal and chrome-nickle windows to cut down on pressure.  They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State building.  The other main issue was the air currents.  You can not strapp a dirigible and believe the back of it swaying back and worth.  When your almost a 11 @NUM1 ft in the air, the wind can be very violent at that height.  If the dirigible ever came off or unhooked before they were done refueling, the dirigible would crash and burn, hundreds of pedestrian on the ground below.  Al Smith had a great idea but he did not realize all the problems.	2	2		2																						164	10	189	5	0	0	4.219653179190751	17.3	43	18	14	6	8	19	93	81.3	8.79	15.04	22	64.9	67.31	6.714285714285714	0.0	230

The whole building had to be strengthed to adjust to the pressure, but the workers eventually got the construction done. However, the biggest thing that hindered the mooring mast from being successful was nature itself. The winds that high in the air were constantly shifting violently, so even if the dirigible had been attached to the mast, the back of it would swivel around uncontrollably.

There was a huge saftey issue having the blimps so close to the city. In paragraph @NUM1, the fear of winds that could blow the blimp into other buildings, wrecking them, scared people. The second concern was the fact that the blimp is full of highly flamable gas and if they blimp was ever to burst into flames above a city, much damage would be done to the blimp and New York City. The last major concern is located in paragraph nine. The problem would be the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to the top of it. The whole building would have to be reconstructed to help the Empire State Building not take on that stress; In fact, basically every part of the building and blimp would have to be remodeled in order to keep New York City, and the passengers of the dirigible safe.	3	3		3																						180	7	195	7	0	0	4.361111111111111	25.714285714285715	55	22	12	5	4	15	105	12.0	7.78	7.54	19	9.8	11.84	12.75	8.8	232

A third problem was finding a way to actually dock the dirigible, this was quickly solved with a winch.

They spent all of their time, effort, and resources to construct something for a purpose that never worked. There were other problems that were overlooked as well, such as the wind speed at that height, and even if they could get close enough to the mast, they would need someone to stand on the very top and tie it down, which would be too hard for one person.

Also the builders knew that since the dirigible would be hooked to the mast by a single cable, the air currents would make the back of the ship swivel around the mooring mast. As said in paragraph @NUM2.  There also was a law enforcement against airships flying too lower over urban areas. That would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. Those are some of the obstacles that the builders were faced with	2	3		3																						124	8	134	1	0	0	4.512	15.625	31	15	9	5	0	9	74	8.8	8.23	7.83	21	7.8	9.02	8.333333333333334	9.2	168
10218	16168	6	The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest building in the World. Al Smith's plans were to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building, but when a @NUM1-foot tall spire was added to the top, the Empire State Building was going to come in second. To overcome this first obstace in building the tower, Smith decided to change the idea for the tower and add his own spire: a mooring mast for dirigibles. Using the tower as an anchor for dirigible balloons, or zeppelins, Smith added another 250 feet to the tower. But to continue with the plan, Smith had to face the obstacle of supporting a floating blimp more than @NUM2 feet above the ground. Smith had the entire building frame modified and strengthened before the building was finished. Smith's final obstacle was one he couldn't control: the weather. The winds at the top of the building were too harsh, so the dirigible idea was scrapped, but Al Smith's tower had made it to the world's tallest building.	2	2		2																						172	8	197	8	0	0	4.6686046511627906	21.5	55	24	15	1	6	21	93	11.3	8.94	8.28	22	8.1	10.23	11.0	9.5	231

Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be supplied, and would also prove to be hazardous. Given the Empire State Building's nature, the modifications became hasselsome and added unnecessary difficulty. The winds at that altitude would also provide docking issues and instability. Finally, the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a small area.

10228	16178	6	It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire state Building. The first reason's that, the law against flying airships to low over the Empire State Building made it hard to do so. Next is that the thoughtes in being unsafe because some dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is flammable A big reason is when the german dirigible got destryed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building then realized how much more worse the accident could have been if it had happened on such a densely populated area suched as downtown New York City. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe. It was clear that there were problems in the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State building; but it is probably a much safer choice for both the residents/citizens of New York and all of the people who ever work(ed) on it such as architects, engineers and the aviation pioners.	3	3		3																						187	5	203	5	0	0	4.625668449197861	37.4	52	18	14	11	7	16	108	19.1	9.64	8.62	29	15.5	17.95	19.333333333333332	14.3	267

The architects knew that the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (par. @NUM1).

The building could potentially collapse with the added weight unless sixty thousand dollars' worth of framework strengthening was made.Another obstacle that the architects faced was nature. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were so strong that the blimps would be swaying too violently to allow for the pilots to dock them safely. The last reason that blimps could not be docked at the Empire State Building was that there were laws against aircraft's flying that low.

First, it would be difficult to build a suitable landing area. As described in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, a dirigible held by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened so that the added stress would be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Also, safety is a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM2, it stated that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders came to realize that if one of the dirigibles were to catch fire, like the German Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would cause huge problems due to the fact that New York is densely populated. Lastly, nature itself is an obstacle for the builders. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting do to violent air current. As described in paragraph @NUM3, the back of the ship would swivle around and the lead weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down below.

10368	16318	6	In the 1920s, dirigibles were considered to be the future of transportation. Although useful, dirigibles had an issue, there was not enough landing area in New York City. With this in mind, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building, he would construct a mooring mast on the top of the building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, refuel, and also allow passengers go on and off. Adding a mooring mast seemed full proof at the time but this new construction plan endured on many obstacles.The first obstacle was how to add a mooring mast without adding stress to the building's frame. Architects detected that the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This led to the second obstacle which was modifying and strengthening the the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the first obstacle. Finally the third obstacle, which was the expense. Modifying the building's new frame work would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Consequently, Al Smith saw a great oppertunity for the Empire State Building but he was faced with many obstacles.	3	3		3																						202	11	228	9	0	0	4.985294117647059	18.545454545454547	69	25	13	8	6	21	111	13.5	11.55	8.11	32	10.8	12.72	12.4	13.2	305

Of course, there are several reasons as to why this plan didn't come to fruition. First of all, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which would make it impossible to tie a dirigible to a building legally. Also, the high powered air currents atop the building would cause a docked dirigible to sway uncontrollably, making it a safety hazard. Finally, many non-U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen to fly instead of helium, and if a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous for civilians.

10391	16341	6	Although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the Empire State Building was a well thought out plan, it provided some obstacles for builders. The biggest problem was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. If an accident, such as fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as New York City. Another factor affecting building was nature. The winds above were constantly shifting due to currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging above a city of people. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low in urban areas. This law makes it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to work.	3	3		3																						160	9	176	6	0	0	4.675	17.77777777777778	47	18	14	10	2	15	88	9.5	8.99	8.57	33	7.9	9.87	7.7142857142857135	10.7	229

Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton"" and planned for the reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan to follow through.

Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Showing the physical insecurity of the ship on the dirigible. Lastly, the law states restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be breaking that law.

One flaw was the violent air currents that would keep the winds around the building constantly moving and would the move back of the dirigible around and around till eventuly the back of the dirigible would hit the building. The other flaw Was that most of the dirigibles was filled with a highly flamable gas known as hydrogen. If the dirigible had exploded and burst into flames like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 then the flaming shell would fall down on the people around the building. Even if the flaws had been fixed, there was already a law that went against the airships flying too low over urban areas and if the airships managed to land on the Empire States Building it would be considered illegal.	3	3		3																						189	6	199	4	0	0	4.560846560846561	31.5	45	22	11	13	5	12	112	15.8	9.41	8.29	27	13.2	15.35	15.25	13.0	260

This project with the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York city it would be catastrophic!

For example, after the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the fear of such an accident occurring in a densely populated areas such as New York posed a problem, because most international dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Another obstacle was the nature of the mooring mast, and the violent air currents that cause shifts in wind. Having a dirigible moored to the top of the Empire State Building, ""dangling high above the pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also, there was an existing laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, therefore making ""it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph @NUM2).

For example, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen, rather than helium, gas. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Therefore, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937. The architects of the Empire State Building foresaw that this could have been a much more tragic event if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Furthermore, anchoring a @NUM1 foot dirigible to the top of a building with a single tether would add stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem, the architects would have to make @MONEY1 in modifications to the building's steel frame. Additionally, there are violent & unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot had to maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible. Clearly, there were practical & safety reasons why the dirigible moor was unable to be completed at the top of the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																						258	14	293	14	0	0	5.050387596899225	18.428571428571427	77	29	22	14	4	32	134	11.7	11.43	8.75	48	10.4	11.2	11.333333333333334	12.5	397
10465	16415	6	Al Smith and his group of architects encountered many problems when they attempted to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in order to dock dirigibles. Before they began building, the architects realized that they could not land a dirigible on the buildings flat roof. They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Although the architects had a great idea, they never realized why it would not work until after building.	4	4		4																						234	10	256	10	0	0	5.042735042735043	23.4	66	34	15	10	4	20	124	14.0	11.73	8.1	38	11.2	11.92	15.5	13.3	361
10466	16416	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. For one, most drigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so it could explode. For instance, on May 6, 1937 the German drigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. There is no predicting that that could never happen again. The greatest obstacle in attempting drigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and even if it was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Drigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets wasn't practical and not safe. Another reason is because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, due to fear over the wind, blowing the drigible in to other buildings in the area which would puncture the drigible's shell and cause a lot of damage.	3	4		4																						203	8	224	11	0	0	4.822660098522167	25.375	55	25	14	10	5	22	116	14.0	10.39	8.86	40	10.8	12.92	10.833333333333334	12.4	287
10468	16418	6	When something is getting invented or built, many obstacles are faced. The number one obstacle was safety. The wind at the top of the empire state building was another problem. The actual building was a problem too. All these problems and the architects tried to work around them, and failed.Safety is important, if one person dies per trip nobody is going to go on the ballon. Safety is important, no safety means no bussiniss. The wind was a huge problem. If the balloon won't stay still while unloading it is very unsafe. The skeleton of the building would have to change and that is an expensive fix. These are some of the major obstacles the architects faced. Maybe one day they will fix it.	2	2		2																						124	12	142	4	0	0	4.584	10.416666666666666	30	16	8	4	4	13	73	6.0	7.52	6.36	13	5.3	6.78	5.666666666666667	9.3	172
10471	16421	6	There were many obstacles that stood in the way of the of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The layout of how the mast would be used was not carefully thought out. One reason is because must dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Due to the fact the dirigible would be relatively in close proximity with the pedestrians and other buildings, it would be unwise to use the mast. In addition there was an existing law stating that the dirigible could not fly low in urban areas, which it would do just that if it attached to the mast. Also, the force of the wind could spin the back of the dirigible, causing it to go around and around the mast. The solution would be to put heavy blocks in the back that could cause it to fall on top of the pedestrians. Overall, there were many reasons why it was unreasonable to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																						161	8	175	6	0	0	4.459627329192546	20.125	31	23	10	11	2	11	106	9.6	8.07	7.38	25	8.8	11.52	12.8	11.9	224

10476	16426	6	Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task, creating this futureistic design carried alot of problems beside it. Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there were also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York.Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg. But and accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical. Because of these problems and more, the thought of using a Mooring Mast to dock Dirigibles was quitely retired.	3	3		3																						212	8	229	7	0	0	4.699530516431925	26.625	47	28	18	15	13	16	122	15.9	10.28	8.42	36	12.7	14.2	28.5	12.5	304

This shows that in order for the dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building, there must be enough landing space. If a mooring mast was added to the top of the building it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. One of the others practical reason why dirigibles could not moore at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The architects could also not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, could add stress to the building's frame.

For many reasons the builders would never get dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.One reason this idea could never happen was because the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable. The hydrogen gas most places used to fuel there dirigibles made them highly flammable. In a highly populated areas such as New York this would be a problem.Another issue would be money. The builders would need more money to strengthen the building for the weight of the dirigibles. With a one thousand foot dirigible moored to the top of a building by a single cable tether there will be a lot of stress on the building.Finally the last reason would be safety.

Even though she failed the test the first time she feels that if she studies and trys again she can pass. This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again. Saeng feels a connection with the plants rebirth and feels she can start over again to and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng vowes to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms."	2	2		2																						117	6	125	0	0	0	4.444444444444445	19.5	30	20	2	7	7	9	68	9.2	8.12	7.03	10	6.2	8.83	8.0	8.3	145
6000	9556	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story. Everything that happed to Saeng  while she was at the florizd  is summed upinto  something resembling vengeance. The whole reason that Saeng was sad in the first place was that she failed her driving test. In the final paragraph, she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus that Saeng  bought will begin budding in the spring, when the snows melt. The last paragraph of the story gives roem for Saeng to dealhtith her nostalgiaover the winter season. Finally, the  geese that fly south make Saeng feel sad, but they light a spark within her she tells herself that she will take the driving test again when the geese return, when the hibiscus buds, and when the snows melt.	2	2		2																						143	7	161	6	0	0	4.52027027027027	21.142857142857142	37	22	8	4	2	18	80	10.6	9.11	7.63	13	7.7	9.84	8.666666666666666	10.0	190
6008	9564	4	The author wrote the paragraph because she went back in side the house to get a dinner and because ain’t going to see the garden until the other day and because the winter come and she will not play outside anymore until the winter goes. Like she said “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”.

6016	9572	4	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story	1	1		1																						70	4	74	0	0	0	4.47887323943662	17.75	15	10	4	7	1	6	42	8.7	8.47	7.21	9	6.6	9.86	10.25	10.1	93
6018	9574	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus"", the auther finishes the story with this last paragraph, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again. The auther finishes the story with that paragraph because in the beginning, Saeng had purchased hibiscus plant because it had reminded her of her hometown. (“Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world”) So she purchased it, but since there was bad weather at the time, Saeng had to get the plant back in time and plant it in the graden. But she failed setting if there on time. That is why it says “I will take that test again"". And she will take it again during the spring when the hibiscus blooms once again.

6019	9575	4	The author concludes the paragraph like this because it shows that she @MONTH1 not going to give up. I @MONTH1 this because she vowed silently to herself that she was going to take the test again during the spring, also, it was the aiudieres not the gains in old years seeds an ezing.

6028	9584	4	I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM1).	1	2		2																						56	4	65	3	0	0	4.696428571428571	14.0	10	11	2	5	1	9	35	7.7	8.34	7.15	7	6.4	7.74	7.25	9.5	78

6032	9588	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes. Saeng vowed silently to herself. That shows she calm down already, she feels better with her new country. She feels the snows meet, the geese return, she says that she will take that test again. It shows one that she doesn’t feel bad with the test more. She knows that she has opportunity to take it again and does it better. She has a different feeling with her problem. She looks her new country with a different eyes. All things with her become better. These are some reasons explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph.	2	1		2																						110	10	123	3	0	0	4.627272727272727	11.0	20	21	8	6	1	14	65	5.9	7.69	7.2	8	4.0	4.76	4.3	6.3	143
6037	9593	4	I believe that author ended the story with that sentence because it give a lifting feeling after the story was so sad. Saeng missed her homeland, was sad, used the flowers as relief, sad about her driving test and realy liked the plant. So the last sentence seemed to fit in as a confort zone to make the reader a bit more relieved.	1	1		1																						63	3	69	3	0	0	4.285714285714286	21.0	18	10	5	3	1	7	35	9.3	7.02	8.44	10	7.9	8.4	10.5	3.1	82
6039	9595	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends the story with this paragraph because it reveals the importance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the story Saeng moves from Vietnam and feels very homesick. She fails her drivers test and is very upset. When she sees the familiar plant she is reminded of her home in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus reminds Saeng of fond memories with her grandmother and simple things such as her fine. Toothed buffalo-horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water. When seeing the familiar plant. “Saeng felt a shock recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. ”This shows how important the hibiscus was to her. The author ended the story with that paragraph to show how the winter hibiscus is a comfort to Saeng and will encourage her to do better on her next driver’s test.	2	2		2																						145	10	158	1	0	0	4.731034482758621	14.5	41	18	15	5	5	18	74	9.9	9.39	7.47	15	8.0	9.45	7.857142857142858	11.5	206
6044	9600	4	The author concludes the story with a sentence about retaking her test when the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding because they each represent something else. The geese represent change because they change their environment in the winter just like Saeng changes her environment by going to the plant place. The hibiscus reminds her of home because at her home there are similar plants. The hibiscus budding represents a new life just like the one Saeng has to live in a new home. Overall, the sentence that the author era’s with is used to show @CAPS1 life as compared to the geese and hibiscus.	2	2		2																						106	5	112	1	0	0	4.69811320754717	21.2	28	16	5	5	2	9	58	11.3	9.57	7.22	12	9.2	10.74	12.0	11.6	149
6054	9610	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it.	2	2		2																						124	5	137	6	0	0	4.435483870967742	24.8	27	19	8	6	5	18	70	11.9	8.07	7.54	14	9.4	11.21	14.0	9.9	163
6059	9615	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show her determination. When she says. “…when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Saeng is explaining how the geese have the determination to fly back and that the hibiscus has the determination to bud again so why shouldn’t she have the determination and confidence to take the test again. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” It seems as if failing the driving test made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country. But after she saw the geese’s and hibiscus’s determination through harsh conditions, she was determined to try the test again.	2	2		2																						117	7	128	3	0	0	4.627118644067797	16.857142857142858	24	25	5	6	6	16	69	15.2	9.82	7.79	11	12.4	13.77	14.5	13.0	161
6060	9616	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to explain how she already took the test and it is now winter, she will retake the test again when all of the flowers and plants come back to life and start again. Saeng wants to take the test again to show her mother that she can pass it, she bought a plant called. dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars to help her mother not be disapointed. However mother was disapointed that she spent that much money on a plant.	1	1		1																						87	4	95	2	0	0	4.379310344827586	21.75	20	16	2	7	3	10	52	13.7	8.25	7.43	6	11.1	12.06	15.5	8.8	111
6061	9617	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things from her home and living, it will comfort her in what she does. The author seems like she needs things from her homeland that help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of earlier life. I think that whenever I want to do a good job It helps to think of the good  things that mean alot to me so I will be happy and want to do good. The author is smart to want to see those things for her to retake her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again it will be good luck for her.	2	2		2																						129	5	135	1	0	0	3.876923076923077	26.0	23	23	8	4	4	6	80	13.1	5.7	7.07	8	11.2	13.85	13.25	8.8	152

6073	9629	4	The reason I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph was because it was a good learning story you can learn something from it .The author did that so you can get a better understanding of the of the story. It said “saeng .teenage  girl, and her family have moved to the united states of Vietnam.” So from reading that it tells me that its telling you what happen right before the story took place. So you can get a better understanding. To me its rapping it all up for you.

6077	9633	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver’s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle.	1	1		1																						52	3	56	1	0	0	4.538461538461538	17.333333333333332	13	9	0	2	0	5	30	8.6	8.29	8.14	8	7.7	10.0	10.666666666666666	11.2	74
6080	9636	4	Saeng is not comftorable in her sorryndings, and has not addapted to the changes from where she moved. She finds the hibiscus and choses to go buy it, because it reminds of her home in @LOCATION2. When she brings it home  her mother seems shocked at first by the price saeng had paid, but is then more sympathetic when she realizes she misses @LOCATION2. Sheang says she is going to retake her test in the spring. She is also implying that she is going to change her attitude about living in @LOCATION1.	2	1		2																						92	5	101	3	0	0	4.43010752688172	18.6	16	18	3	5	3	12	56	8.8	7.95	8.5	12	6.9	11.27	11.2	11.2	124

6083	9639	4	The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that.	1	1		1																						62	3	67	1	0	0	4.080645161290323	20.666666666666668	10	14	0	3	2	6	38	8.1	6.04	6.45	2	5.5	8.28	10.333333333333334	3.1	70
6086	9642	4	The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng.	1	2		2																						94	5	103	4	0	0	4.351063829787234	18.8	21	13	6	7	3	12	55	14.7	7.79	7.04	8	12.0	14.22	17.0	9.7	122
6087	9643	4	The author ends the story with  “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. “ A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her.” She wants to be able to handle the loss better. The author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over.	2	2		2																						132	6	143	4	0	0	3.962406015037594	22.166666666666668	26	23	7	12	6	15	76	10.5	5.64	6.62	9	8.9	11.47	13.25	8.2	161

When she says this she is refering to her drivers test she says she will take the test again because she is reminded that her family didnt give up they moved to @LOCATION1 for a fresh start “plant she had forgotten drew her back to her childhood world. “She sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before.

6098	9654	4	When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he don’t want people to think that she just worries about the plants.	1	1		1																						72	5	76	0	0	0	4.152777777777778	14.4	15	15	2	4	2	6	45	7.1	6.2	6.72	3	5.6	7.76	8.25	6.0	84
6105	9661	4	She said this too show the determination it takes to make it no matter how many times you fail you need to get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this way also, it takes alot for someone to fail something and to get back up and try again on it. She isnt willing to accept failure, and she's trying to redeem her failure so she says she'll try again.

6137	9694	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means that when she gets older and gets more confidence then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready just like the hibiscus will be ready to start to budding again.	1	1		1																						71	1	72	0	0	0	4.253521126760563	71.0	10	14	5	5	4	1	45	34.1	8.5	9.16	6	26.3	29.53	38.5	0.0	87

6148	9705	4	The author included this paragraph to show how much the girl missed Vietnam. When the girl saw the hibiscus it brought back memories of Vietnam. Seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort. So the paragraph is there to show how the United States is different from Vietnam. Since the United States has changing seasons it allows the girl to get use to the United States. The plant will always be there, but she has to look for the good that United States provides. The author states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote shows how the girl was getting use to the United States. How she will always remember Vietnam, and finds things in the United States that remind her of Vietnam. In conclusion, the paragraph is used to show how much the girl missed Vietnam, but how she finds comfort within the United States.	1	2		2																						172	10	189	8	0	0	4.680232558139535	17.2	49	28	7	9	3	13	97	10.2	9.28	6.42	15	8.4	9.5	7.142857142857142	9.4	235

She adds this because the snow is melted, the hibiscus is budding, and the geese return is a perfect time because everything is back and warm. She says ""when they come back...then I will take the test again.” means she will have all confidence to take the test. Saeng voweds to take it again and she will and she thinks this time she will pass. That's what theauthor concludes this to the story."	1	1		1																						90	6	101	2	0	0	4.388888888888889	15.0	15	17	4	4	4	12	61	8.2	7.02	6.99	8	5.6	8.53	8.8	8.2	110
6160	9717	4	In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story “Winter Hibiscus”. In the story the young girl finishes of by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself” but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last “vowe” is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girls determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says “and this hibiscus is budding” its showing the girls connection with the plant because of the comfort and canfidence it given her, ecpecially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl was with her the flower and the homeland.	2	2		2																						161	6	169	3	0	0	4.708074534161491	26.833333333333332	39	21	11	7	6	17	92	14.2	9.99	8.5	28	12.6	14.7	12.4	14.1	239
6169	9726	4	The author ends the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the passage “When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time. I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her home land so she thought when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. The plant made her think positivly. And insted of thinking she will fail she is thinking she will pass the next time. I also think Saeng felt comforting her when she was upset and I think that helped her feel alot better.	2	2		2																						138	6	145	2	0	0	4.260869565217392	23.0	23	31	6	9	5	11	81	12.4	7.38	6.95	10	9.3	12.49	18.333333333333332	10.4	172
6173	9730	4	The author conconcludes the story with this paragraph because, the plant brings back memories to Saeng and she is sort of like the plant. Saeng can be compared to the plant by, she is starting out in a new area that she is unfamiliar with, as well as the plant. The plant is now being planted in the soil outside of her house and has to grow. Saeng has to learn to grow aswell and get better and prepare to take the test again. So when the plant is grown and adapted Saeng believes she will be grown and adapted too. In conclusion, this paragraph is a perfect ending for the story “Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho.	2	2		2																						117	6	127	4	0	0	4.239316239316239	19.5	25	18	5	10	6	13	69	8.3	6.79	7.03	13	7.4	9.51	10.6	8.3	148

6181	9738	4	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has new. found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her."	2	2		2																						200	12	232	9	0	0	4.54	16.666666666666668	51	30	11	11	6	29	110	11.1	8.12	7.66	18	8.4	10.28	11.2	9.7	252
6183	9740	4	“In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibisus is budding, then I will take that test again” Saeng thinks to herself. Saeng finds herself in a new place were she has no friends. She finds comfort in a plant shop one day when she comes apon a Hibiscus flower. The flower calms her spierit and helps her beguin to adjust to the changes in her life at this time.	2	1		2																						75	5	81	2	0	0	4.1466666666666665	15.0	22	12	2	2	3	13	40	7.5	6.33	7.94	6	5.9	8.59	8.875	7.2	89
6187	9744	4	In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose the to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. Saeng’s situation is similar to the flower’s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home	3	3		3																						158	7	176	14	0	0	4.7215189873417724	22.571428571428573	36	25	11	3	8	24	83	14.0	9.81	8.96	28	11.1	13.79	15.75	12.7	223
6202	9759	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver’s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph.	2	2		2																						55	3	58	0	0	0	4.163636363636364	18.333333333333332	11	10	2	1	0	4	33	7.3	6.56	6.27	3	6.9	8.77	8.833333333333334	7.8	69
6210	9767	4	Emotions,symbolizim, to it realized – all are reasons the author concluded the story that way. a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you, with mixed emotions. Emotions like sadness, hope, and wounder. The author makes the reader feel sad with the girl failing her test and missing home. The author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered. the author uses symbolizes in the concluding, sentances by giving the plant and the geese a sense of impotance in the story and the plant has to do with the home that she really misses. In the final story the author leaves a lot of peceptions on several. Like the importance of the plant and why did they move from a place that they lavd so much. That is why I think the author ended the story that way.	2	1		2																						158	10	175	6	0	0	4.405063291139241	15.8	47	23	5	5	6	18	85	10.6	7.96	7.46	21	9.7	11.32	14.25	10.3	216
6215	9772	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.	1	1		1																						53	1	56	1	0	0	4.3584905660377355	53.0	7	11	1	2	1	3	35	25.6	8.66	8.35	4	20.4	21.2	26.5	0.0	67
6220	9777	4	Several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life. Also when the hibiscus starts budding she will feel conforted, as though it auomaticaly brings back her childhood memories. It also is a link to her past home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again. Its as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, she will also be ready.	2	2		2																						85	5	96	6	0	0	4.270588235294118	17.0	17	12	8	5	1	12	52	7.2	6.44	6.71	9	6.4	8.68	8.7	9.4	109
6227	9784	4	I think the author concludes like this because its almost like a new beginning. The ending of the story makes you think that Saeng is going to get on with her life. It makes me think that @CAPS1 plans to start her life over in comparison with the hibiscus. Once the plant “starts over” (rebuds) she will start over once again. It also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in @LOCATION1. She will not let her life be distraught by her move Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to start her life over again. The ending is a “cliff hanger” to show that her story has not yet completely ended. It shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life. It also shows she doesn’t let her failures control her. She is a strong young woman and is determined to overcome this.	2	2		2																						154	11	167	0	0	0	4.266233766233766	14.0	27	27	7	10	1	17	95	5.7	6.31	6.89	17	5.2	7.42	7.0	8.3	198
6234	9791	4	The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. It show a small amount of newfound confidence Saeng now has. This ending also shows how much of an effect the “Winter hibiscus” had on her. with bringing back memories of her old country. If Saeng wouldn’t have found the hibiscus, she would have never started to reminisce about her old home. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her past, but it also helped her compare her new home to her old home. Through this she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so bad, and that she still has a little bit of her old home with her everyday. This realization gave her just enough hope and confidence to want to try the driving test again This ending shows the change of heart Saeng feels for @LOCATION1 and her small gain of hope and confidence.	3	2		3																						162	8	174	4	0	0	4.432098765432099	20.25	40	23	14	9	5	16	93	11.0	8.25	7.12	16	8.8	11.71	11.8	11.8	216
6237	9794	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again”. She is saying that she wants to start over. and adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again. because she says “when the snow melts and the geese return.” She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way.	2	1		2																						128	8	138	4	0	0	4.1171875	16.0	22	27	5	4	2	15	75	10.8	6.33	6.88	8	8.6	10.87	13.0	7.6	155
6238	9795	4	I think the author concludes the story like that because its showing the time that will be passing. When it shows time passing, she’s grew up more and maybe she’ll be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is. Also because the hibiscus will be budding, that will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed because it all make her feel more like secure home feeling. “hibiscus is budding” this way the flower will be starting new and so will she.	2	1		2																						85	4	91	2	0	0	4.376470588235295	21.25	14	15	6	6	3	10	51	13.4	8.01	7.64	10	10.8	12.26	14.833333333333334	7.8	107
6243	9800	4	In the story “winter @CAPS1” the author concludes the story with the last paragraph like that because when the season comes back around for budding she is going to be right back out there exsploring. She’s going to want to learn more about the hibiscus and what they do. And she can’t wait to start taking care of them as they start to bud. Thats why they ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																						73	5	78	0	0	0	4.383561643835616	14.6	9	16	3	7	2	8	44	8.3	7.78	6.92	7	6.9	8.42	8.625	7.2	93

6247	9804	4	In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with “in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to make a point.

6249	9806	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 reason why he does is because he wants to conclude by writing about geese. Second he like plants and the season’s that they bud. He vowed that he would take that test in the spring. He cant wait until the snow melts so that way he can take the test.	1	1		1																						59	4	64	0	0	0	4.220338983050848	14.75	12	11	2	1	1	6	36	5.8	6.14	7.05	4	4.3	5.92	6.375	3.1	71

Its not a real one I’m mean not the kind we had at-at” she was still too shaky to say the words at home” when the hibiscus buds” she will still be fond of her home but she will have adapted better to her current enviroment. The geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day. When she finds that place she will find herself ready to “take the test"" or do things normally.

She  said now all the new  @CAPS1 things seemed  weird to her when she first got here , but now  they are second nature to her now  . I think that  the  hibiscus is an can of  hope and inspiration to her . I  think  that she finally realizes  that  she  is in  @LOCATION1 to stay  and  she  can  go  back to  vietnam . So she has to accept  that  she  is  here home  and I think she  is  on her  way  to  doing  that .	2	2		2																						106	5	138	1	0	0	2.9782608695652173	27.6	17	14	4	9	4	4	70	6.4	4.24	6.68	9	11.1	9.6	11.0	8.8	159

When  the snows  melt and the geese  return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because  it show that even though the main character Saeng, @MONTH1 a failed once, she will trying again too. The  geese  will  be coming back to try out a  new  spring  and  the  hibiscus  will be budding new flowers so its like its starting over again as well and Saeng  says  that  if  both  have  made it once they tried again then   she can as well but this time she will succeed.

6267	9824	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new life style. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change.	2	2		2																						97	4	108	7	0	0	4.639175257731959	24.25	22	15	7	2	4	12	57	12.5	9.29	8.1	14	9.2	11.78	13.375	9.5	129
6271	9828	4	The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory’s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject.	1	2		2																						148	6	158	4	0	0	4.277027027027027	24.666666666666668	36	21	6	5	3	13	88	11.1	7.43	7.42	13	9.4	10.96	13.75	8.3	188
6276	9833	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng . After failing the drivers test, saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort  to  help  her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence  she decides to plant it. “The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. “Then she sees geese flying in the sky which  is kind of a symbol do that day, something to rembember  it by, so the next year.” When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” She will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger.	3	2		3																						185	10	203	5	0	0	4.178010471204188	19.1	38	30	9	13	7	21	109	14.2	7.79	7.73	20	11.7	13.58	13.75	10.5	234

As she began to plant her hibiscus she again compared herself to it and that is why when her plant blooms on the spring so well she will pass that test	2	3		3																						143	5	153	1	0	0	4.066666666666666	30.0	30	21	2	8	8	9	90	34.2	8.15	10.5	17	27.6	30.56	54.0	0.0	186
6288	9845	4	I am going to tell you why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason the author does is because it tells you that Saeng is confident. It also tells you she wont give up. And it shows that she is willing to take her ability to the next level. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																						63	5	69	0	0	0	4.174603174603175	12.6	11	10	3	1	1	5	42	4.5	5.61	6.27	4	4.7	6.31	5.7	6.7	82

6315	9872	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One being the fact that she wants to snow sympathay for the hibiscus. Another reason would be showing that Saeng wants to make her mother very proud of her. Meaning that she doesn’t want her mom to think that she is going to give up. This also contributes to the reason that Saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test. Lastly I think that this last paragraph snowed how Saeng wants people to know that even some as small and meaning less as a plant can help her overcome obsticles, and lead her to her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to end the story because of the main fact that how we know that Saeng will not stop believing in herself.	2	2		2																						141	7	149	1	0	0	4.375886524822695	20.142857142857142	25	30	6	5	3	11	83	9.3	7.78	7.1	13	7.6	9.46	8.0	8.4	181
6320	9877	4	I belive the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed that it doesn’t mean her lifes over. She will requperate and to the same thing next year.	1	1		1																						39	3	42	0	0	0	4.589743589743589	13.0	7	8	2	1	1	5	24	6.7	7.99	7.93	5	4.8	6.23	5.833333333333333	6.4	51
6327	9884	4	The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the “metaphor” compares Saeng and her test to the perenial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathalon, and my goal was to place first, I place @NUM1 overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathalon came again, and I placed @NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.	1	2		2																						122	3	143	16	0	0	4.647540983606557	40.666666666666664	26	21	6	9	6	24	70	20.8	9.53	8.76	12	15.6	17.26	18.333333333333332	11.9	158
6330	9887	4	The author include these paragraph in the story because the it spring, when the snows melt and the geese return. I think the author is talk about winter when it snows and keep snowing until spring hit and then the snow start to melt a way because the sun came out. One reason, is the author is talk about how it change weather when it changes.	0	0		0																						66	3	71	2	0	0	4.212121212121212	22.0	17	12	1	1	3	5	37	9.4	6.73	5.92	3	7.2	8.8	11.0	3.1	80
6340	9897	4	I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because it’s  meaning fail odvestily Saeng  really like garden and it’s  something  special to her .

6347	9904	4	"In the last paragraphy the reason why the author uses ""when they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test. The author uses this because Saeng finally had found comfort. after  moving from a her homeland veelnam to the united States, she felt home sick. For example, she comes across this flower that reminds her of the time she spent in her homeland. She remember he grandmother's smell because of the plant. So when she finally got home to her mother, she showed the flower to her. They both planted the flower, and @CAPS1 got a sense of relief. Thats why she vowed that when winter was oven and spring came she would take that test, because she had a sense of home in her, that gave her uncouragement and strength. it also shows that even when your are in a different area and you are chew, there's always something that can male you remember the unemove and lime spent where you can from"	2	2		2																						179	9	201	9	0	0	4.377777777777778	20.0	38	27	7	9	7	25	111	12.1	7.84	6.94	14	9.7	11.36	11.4	10.0	231
6351	9908	4	The author concludes the story w/this paragraph because she really isnt worried about when they take the test again, she’s only concerned w/the plants she picked out. Also, she knows that it will be a really long time before she takes the test again so that gives her more time to study and get more prepared and focused. The author also ends this article w/this paragraph because she wants to let the readers know that since she failed the @NUM1 time she will be back again to take it over and nothing will stop the author from failing.	1	1		1																						98	3	110	2	0	0	4.489795918367347	32.666666666666664	17	17	6	10	3	9	64	16.1	8.83	8.64	10	12.5	13.49	17.333333333333332	8.8	125
6354	9911	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the story with the lines “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason that the author concludes the test with these lines is because she is re-establing the symbolism of the plant. In the text it said that the plant budds in the spring, once it has time to grow and adapt to the new enviroment. Just as the plant needed that time so did the main character Saeng. She just moved from Vietnam and failed her drivers test. Saeng is very unsure of her new culture. For example she likes bitter melon it says. “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself much prefered it to a Big Mac.” She appears to think she is misunderstood an no one likes her, but just as the plant will adapt to this new life so will she.	3	3		3																						174	9	190	7	0	0	4.275862068965517	19.333333333333332	39	29	8	11	6	22	101	13.2	7.56	8.25	21	9.9	13.21	18.0	9.7	217
6361	9918	4	The author concludes the story saying that because she wants to show us that Saeng is confident in herself and will not hesitate to take the test again. She went over to the corner of the vegteble patch and started to dig a hole in the ground.	1	1		1																						47	2	49	0	0	0	4.191489361702128	23.5	8	9	2	1	2	4	30	10.1	7.09	7.49	6	8.9	11.95	13.25	0.0	61

6368	9925	4	"In the story called ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes the story with this paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, than I will take that test again."" The reason why the author had put that at the end of the story was because when things go under ground everyone wants to wait and wait until it comes back up again because when you fail everything goes down but if you wait awhile than everything will start to raise Just like flowers and everything else that you can think of. So that is why the author put that at the end of the story cause to tell people that it is ok for people to fail Just as long as you get up and try again until you reach your goal. So that is what the author was talking about and thats why Minfong Ho put that at the end of the story so that people can read and learn for what it says."	1	2		2																						182	4	195	4	0	0	4.0989010989010985	45.5	32	31	2	14	8	13	120	20.6	6.98	7.45	8	16.3	18.42	27.5	10.1	222
6375	9932	4	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up.	1	2		2																						128	8	139	1	0	0	4.6328125	16.0	27	26	6	7	5	9	79	8.4	8.76	6.9	14	7.2	7.03	6.857142857142857	7.6	173
6379	9936	4	The reason I think author concludes this story with this last paragraph is because this is @CAPS1 passion. And that Saeng is very and will do this every year. She really love plants and she will wait to do it again. The last paragraph really showed a lot of dedication. And she really values the spring and the Hibiscus.	0	0		0																						59	5	64	0	0	0	4.440677966101695	11.8	14	8	2	5	5	7	39	5.4	7.0	6.9	7	5.5	6.08	5.9	8.8	81
6382	9939	4	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn’t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task	1	2		2																						112	4	115	0	0	0	4.241071428571429	28.0	24	15	5	1	1	6	73	12.5	7.43	7.7	13	10.7	12.63	13.75	10.1	145
6385	9942	4	The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the hibiscus flower will be adaptating to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has began to grow older and much wiser of things allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now of where she is living just how the hibiscus flower adapts to it's place with ease and gets use to seasons.	2	3		3																						172	5	187	10	0	0	4.593023255813954	34.4	44	23	9	13	6	19	97	21.7	9.65	8.34	18	17.7	19.06	19.333333333333332	14.2	236
6393	9950	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has something to work for.The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could want to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are the reasons why I think the author put that conclude with the paragraph	1	1		1																						75	3	78	0	0	0	4.381578947368421	25.333333333333332	13	14	2	6	2	3	51	18.2	8.89	6.76	4	14.4	15.0	18.75	0.0	94
6397	9954	4	The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time that Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, were the winter Hibiscus are popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this maner because it remins Saeng about Vietnam, and how she feels better during that time of year. When she says “And beside it was yet another old friend.” She feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable. This is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did.	1	2		2																						102	6	109	2	0	0	4.323529411764706	17.0	23	12	5	6	4	10	60	9.1	7.37	7.43	9	7.7	9.73	11.2	9.4	131
6403	9960	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.	1	1		1																						100	4	104	0	0	0	4.18	25.0	20	16	4	5	8	3	64	10.8	7.03	6.46	6	8.3	10.4	13.0	7.2	121
6407	9964	4	The last line is included in the story “Winter Hibiscus” because it showed the connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time she decides to take it again in the spring. The hibiscus flower like Saeng is out of place and will have to make it through the winter into the spring so it can bud again. This shows how like the flower Saeng will bud again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions in @LOCATION1. So they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to. This shows again how the last line connects the girl and the flower together. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to wrap up the story with a connection between the flower and Saeng.	2	3		3																						150	8	159	1	0	0	4.333333333333333	18.75	37	21	5	7	5	12	96	8.3	7.49	6.25	10	7.1	9.39	11.6	9.8	193
6411	9968	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it expresses the meaning of the story. Life continues no matter what, the hibiscus will return again in the spring. The hibiscus is like a symbol to Saeng's life. The plant normally doesn't survive in winter months, but this one did. The mother says, ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are just like the plant. They are strong and their lives will continue even though they are in a  new environment The author chose to end the story with that parragraph because even  though she say the hibiscus will come back every spring the deeper meaning is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will continue to live their lives."	2	2		2																						135	7	158	7	0	0	4.671532846715328	19.571428571428573	35	15	5	11	5	19	84	10.5	9.17	6.7	14	8.5	9.79	7.142857142857142	10.3	186
6413	9970	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story. I said this idea because in the story he talks about orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vires surrounded her. It talks about how these flowers surrounded her to test her. Of her @CAPS1.	0	0		0																						58	4	66	4	0	0	4.793103448275862	14.5	18	10	0	0	1	10	31	8.4	9.04	8.44	12	6.6	7.87	7.25	8.8	82

6426	9983	4	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character.	2	2		2																						184	10	205	10	0	0	4.486486486486487	18.5	45	23	12	14	7	26	103	10.1	8.18	7.33	18	7.6	9.4	8.0	8.8	237

6459	10016	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. Durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it it’s winter and the hibiscus hasen’t bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And thats why I think the author ended with that paragraph.	2	2		2																						123	9	132	0	0	0	4.211382113821138	13.666666666666666	24	21	2	10	4	10	77	6.1	6.2	7.35	14	5.8	7.14	6.857142857142857	8.1	158

When Saeng bought the hibiscus, she was sure that as soon as the winter passes with the coming of spring, she is sure that taking the drivers test, again will be easier to overcome the fear and grieving times in a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place.

6508	10065	4	I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” @CAPS1 it’s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again.	2	2		2																						107	3	114	3	0	0	4.472222222222222	36.0	25	19	6	8	1	16	62	17.6	9.06	8.21	12	13.7	15.78	18.0	9.7	137

This amphasis that Saeng will be strong and more confident in the spring. That’s why the author put it in at the end.

6526	10083	4	In the short story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author includes a paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. Ho, includes this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States, her and her mother had moved here from Vietnam. Throughout the story she is reminising about her home life in Vietnam. About her grandmother, and the flowers there. “Where was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?” When at the flower shop, Saeng finds an hibiscus, flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, wants to become adapted to the @LOCATION3 and beable to live here without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show Saeng too, wants to adapt to her surrounding and pass the driving test,	0	0		0																						180	12	208	15	0	2	4.677777777777778	15.0	46	32	8	10	4	30	101	8.8	8.47	7.17	21	7.3	8.12	8.5	8.8	243

6535	10092	4	“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter.	3	3		3																						205	9	224	11	0	0	4.765853658536585	22.77777777777778	49	38	8	13	7	28	110	13.9	9.99	8.68	32	10.9	12.78	11.8	11.9	291

She missed being home so much because nothing was the same. “It’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. ‘I mean, not like the kind we had at-at'. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. “But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, she decided that she was going to give the drive’s test one more try. “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""	2	2		2																						136	7	151	5	0	0	4.286764705882353	19.428571428571427	26	22	7	10	3	18	83	21.4	7.85	8.21	11	17.4	19.88	19.0	12.5	171
6550	10107	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph before they were talking about the “winter hibiscus” and the geese.

6563	10120	4	THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE REASON BEING THAT THE AUTHOR WANTED TO REALLY SHOW THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER. ANOTHER REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME. FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THAT PARAGRAPH IT SAYS “THEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.”, ITS RELATING THAT SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER. WHICH THEN RELATES IT TO THE THEME OF ADJUSTING AND KEEP TRYING TILL YOU ADJUST.

6568	10125	4	Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding.

6571	10128	4	The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginnig of the story the girl failed the test. And so when she told her mother she saw that she was upset with it. So after they planted the plant she decided to take the test over knowing that her mother would think the best of it. Also its in there because the story started out with her telling her mother that she failed the test.  And if you kept it out people who read it would be like, ok, so her mother just let her fail the test and didn’t do anything about it. Plus when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they are going to be wanting to know if she took it again, and why she took it again if she did.	1	1		1																						137	6	148	4	0	0	3.9420289855072466	23.0	20	25	3	9	5	9	90	10.9	5.58	6.72	8	9.3	11.54	10.4	6.7	165
6576	10133	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he’s saying that once winter and spring’s over and the hibiscus is budding, then I’ll start over again and try again.

6578	10135	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when she come back from taking driver's test on the way home she saw winter hibiscus that was so beautiful. Then she went to the store and buy that flowers and it cost a lot of money when she got home and her mom planting vejetable and her mom ark her what is that so she tell th truth and her know that the flower costs a lot of money she get mad with the dheredulously of her how can she do that - Saeng take a big decision that she going to that eventhough her mom mad she she love that flowers I guess because it remaind of in Vietnam. The author put this paragraph I think because that the geese return and the flowers is growth she will take the test again bease that when she buy is no flowers came out yet so when it came out she will go again just to let her know that you see the first time and waite when it growth than you can take the test again In my onpion that is a good ending and also it a good question too.	1	2		2																						204	5	208	0	0	0	3.906862745098039	40.8	40	32	8	14	8	10	129	30.9	6.52	8.63	13	25.0	27.67	26.5	9.7	244
6582	10139	4	The author concludes the story with “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She does this to show now Saeng is adapting and making decisions in her new country just like she did in her homeland. In Vietnam Saeng used to brush her grandmothers hair and help put it into a bun and put a hibiscus in it. That was one of her traditions with it. Also when she used to get water from the well a hibiscus would sometimes come up with the bucket. Both these thus the hibiscus was seen as a comfort object, now as she is in the states, she is trying to put it to good use, while also taking into account what repeats in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and plants start to grow in the spring. By her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom. The plant being potted in her garden and Saeng moving her both signify change, but a rembrance of old traditions, and a space for new.	3	3		3																						214	9	231	8	0	0	4.116822429906542	23.77777777777778	46	34	6	13	10	19	136	9.9	6.45	6.37	17	9.0	10.64	11.2	9.4	269
6592	10150	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she want the reader to see that saeng will not stop until she passes her drivers test, just like the geese won’t stop until they are in the south for winter. the author is trying to show the beauty of trying again and going through your obstcles to your goal.	1	2		2																						59	2	62	1	0	0	4.406779661016949	29.5	14	10	1	2	1	6	35	28.8	8.9	8.7	6	22.8	24.28	30.5	0.0	77

6627	10186	4	What the author is talking about is that the snow was melting and the spring is coming. I guess what they mean is that flowers, trees and grass are going back beautiful. Also he was letting us know that spring is here and that is not winter nomore. Thats why she start to plant plants in the winter. So in the spring that can grow out to be nice and beautiful for the spring. Thats what i think the author meant. Also thats the reason why he put that in the paragraph. He should of add more to the paragraph like how the plants and stuff was growing so beautiful.

6633	10192	4	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng was a very determined person. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng was a strong character because throughout the story she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time. But when she failed, the author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up hope and that she was going to take the test again.	1	1		1																						79	3	83	1	0	0	4.506329113924051	26.333333333333332	17	14	4	5	2	5	50	13.0	8.88	6.94	7	10.0	11.53	14.166666666666666	8.8	104

When she says, “When the geese return” their faint honks and flying overhead are familiar to her now season upon season. Also when the hibiscus is budding because this will remind her of her home in Vietnam seeing flower and hearing these geese will give her the confidence and encouragement to retake the drivers test.	2	2		2																						120	4	130	6	0	0	4.545454545454546	30.25	29	18	5	5	6	14	68	20.1	9.35	8.12	14	15.4	17.33	17.666666666666668	10.5	159

6644	10203	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus “decided to end the story with this paragraph because its like a new beginning for saeng. In saeng moves and fails the test .The winter hibiscus comforts her from the memories of where she used to live. It gives her hope and in the winter it wouldn’t be as nice as it would be in the spring. Spring is also time for new beginnings because in the winter everything dies and comes back to life in spring .saeng feels she would take the test as a new beginning. From my personal experience I always do spring cleaning because I want to begin fresh. Spring is also filled with fresh air and gives me inspiration to do good. This could be why saeng wants to take the test in the spring time. Therefore the author of “Winter Hibiscus “decided to end the story with that paragraph because they wanted to show how saeng wanted a new beginning.	3	2		3																						161	8	169	0	0	0	4.385093167701863	20.125	41	23	11	6	4	13	89	9.3	7.78	6.79	12	7.6	9.78	12.0	10.7	216
6658	10217	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to explain to us that this plant is going to bring good luck. The snow will melt, the geese will return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. Its starting over fresh, a new beggining. Since she had failed her driving test she will start over in the spring. In conclusion this is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																						76	5	83	2	0	0	4.526315789473684	15.2	16	15	3	0	1	7	42	7.5	7.82	6.47	9	5.7	7.66	7.199999999999999	7.6	98
6659	10218	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to say in the spring when the plant starts over Saeng will start over to. The story shows that this is the meaning because Saeng was having a really hard winter and was having a hard time adjusting to all of the new things, but in the spring she can start over just like the hibiscus will.	1	1		1																						69	2	72	1	0	0	4.217391304347826	34.5	15	9	3	4	2	4	42	15.7	7.5	7.41	5	12.0	14.96	18.75	0.0	86
6663	10222	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show us that her days with nature is not yet over, for when it comes back around, she will continue to do what she been was doing, whicvh was growing her plants, taking care of them, tuning them out to being a goodnight dinner, and to continue that until she’s no longer to do anymore.	0	0		0																						64	1	71	6	0	0	4.3125	64.0	10	12	0	8	1	9	44	30.9	7.97	10.51	9	24.7	26.85	35.0	0.0	83

6678	10237	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons, Saeng was dissapointed for failing her driving test. She found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus his not started to bud, she should not take the drivers test. She feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus. This implies nature comforts her. The author ended it like this because it shows Saeng is not disappointed about failing is anymore. She knows she will have another chance next year when the geese returns and the hibiscus starts to bud. With the comfort of nature, she feels she can pass the test next year.	2	2		2																						123	8	134	3	0	0	4.626016260162602	15.375	28	23	6	1	4	11	67	8.1	8.46	7.35	18	5.8	7.46	7.0	8.5	165
6680	10239	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows her determination. Saeng is having problems with both adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life. we see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” we see that Saeng bought the flower because it made her feel securit. It was something from home that felt familiar to her and I believe thats why she included the story with this paragraph because next year she will have a sense of security and familiarity when taking the test because the experience she had will be making again.	2	2		2																						132	5	140	3	0	0	4.515151515151516	26.4	29	24	5	4	3	13	78	21.9	9.42	8.69	15	18.1	20.63	18.666666666666668	13.6	181
6681	10240	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up.

6688	10247	4	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed. Since she has failed the test the first time she wants to overcome her failure and succede in it so the author wants her to look determined in the end.	1	1		1																						93	2	100	5	0	0	4.354838709677419	46.5	17	16	4	4	3	9	57	22.3	8.43	8.83	12	17.9	20.32	25.75	0.0	117

6698	10257	4	When the author concluded the narrative by when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles, finding comfort in a time of disappointment, and her connection to her past experiences. First, it demostrates the ability to overcome obstacles because they are obstacles in everyone lives, and you don’t have a choice to conquer them because there are unlimited. So the hibiscus flower represents the obsticles and the weather represent time because weather is stopping the flower to bloom and bloosom. Secondly, it also represent the finding of comfot in a time of disappointment because when you have going through an obstacle you would find disappointment there lingering. However she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back and she have the awareness of the obstacles coming back. Finally, it asserts her connection to her past experience because she is trapped in a world that she is not familiar with, which would make her an alien. She capture the sense of being out of place, because you can relate that the hiatcus flower would be her because she is eccentric and different from the rest of the people in her environment she is trying to adapt her way of living and trying to survive in the world, like when she was in her own country.	2	2		2																						242	7	262	13	0	0	4.818181818181818	34.57142857142857	50	38	8	13	9	26	148	18.6	10.8	8.22	35	15.6	17.15	22.333333333333332	15.7	360
6704	10263	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she saying when everything gets back to normal that’s when she is going to take the test again. Second, because there would be nothing else to say if it is not back to the way she wanted it to be. For instance, if you were building an house and a blizzared came, you would stop, you said that you would not continue until there was nice weather again.

Saeng decided to tell her mother what she had done, “she failed the test” probably her mom get upset with her but then she talk to her again. Saeng  mather’s ask her about the plant that she have with her. Saeng said that she buy the plant by @MONEY1. She was sad because she failed the test and when she buy the plant it probalbly makes her feel better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it bring some kind of hope to her, and she probably will pass the test.

6746	10305	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driver’s test. To Saeng her failing the driver’s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng’s promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didn’t give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.	3	2		3																						198	9	213	6	0	0	4.666666666666667	22.0	47	35	7	11	5	23	111	11.6	9.34	7.36	21	9.5	10.62	11.8	10.5	269

6787	10346	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I believe she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, someday being symbolized by when the geese come back.

The reason why the author said that Is because she Is trying to tell the readers to get right back up and do it again, If you fell once there Is no harm and trying again. When its spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promise to take the drive's test. After failing a driver test Saeng buys a flower at a florIst that remInded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and put it in the garden. Told her mother that she fail, Saeng's mother was very understand and told her maybe next time In conclusion the author ‘write the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life."	1	2		2																						166	7	186	7	0	0	4.234939759036145	23.714285714285715	37	30	3	15	8	19	103	12.3	6.85	7.2	12	10.6	12.04	13.0	8.8	208
6819	10378	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again maybe you will do alot better.	1	1		1																						103	5	110	2	0	0	4.776699029126213	20.6	20	14	4	8	0	7	64	11.4	10.04	6.04	8	10.1	9.79	12.0	11.2	151

6840	10399	4	The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes.	2	1		2																						93	8	103	2	0	0	4.537634408602151	11.625	23	20	4	3	4	12	52	5.8	7.23	7.27	13	5.5	5.5	5.4375	7.6	128

Basically, the hibiscus(a plant) meant much to the narrator and her mother which was dying and they dug up a hole to help it to grow, so when it grows again that proves that it will be living better. So when Saeng relates the test that will be her her having the opportunity to past the test. The story with this paragraph symbolizing a new beginning about to take place.

6936	10496	4	The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it.	1	1		1																						86	3	91	1	0	0	4.058139534883721	28.666666666666668	16	11	3	4	4	4	58	12.0	6.51	7.26	6	10.9	11.95	15.0	7.8	108

Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to the together her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents newhope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually succeed. In addition, in the text it says, “it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.” Saeng’s past memones could be reached when this hibiscus was in new and that served as immense inspiration to her.

7045	10609	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is willing to give the test another try. She is now more open –minded about the situation. In the beginning of the story, Saeng was upset and annoyed about failing her driver’s test. For example, “the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I-I failed the test,” Saeng said to her mother. Obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself. The author didn’t want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending. Saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. For example, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” I believe that this attitude was because of the memorys of her mother country that soothes her and also her mother. In conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal.	2	3		3																						194	11	215	10	0	0	4.587628865979381	17.636363636363637	50	28	7	7	8	29	106	9.9	8.65	7.37	20	8.5	9.82	7.2857142857142865	10.1	269
7047	10611	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because when the snow melts and the geese return, she going to have higher confidence in taking and passing the test. After she failed the test later on in the story the geeses had flew away. So when the geese return the geese will remind her of what had just now happened. When the snow melts and spring comes the hibiscus flower will bloom once again.	1	1		1																						76	4	82	2	0	0	4.447368421052632	19.0	17	13	3	8	3	7	42	9.0	8.07	7.07	8	7.2	8.65	9.0	7.2	97
7051	10615	4	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotion connection to the memories and flashbacks that the Hibiscus brings back to her. At one point in the story, she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back aware of memories. Later on in the story, she takes the plant to her mother. At first @PERSON1 is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughter’s actions and feelings. Saeng is upset that she didn’t pass her test and her mother understands that. I think the author ends the story this way because wants the reader to see that because the hibiscuses is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, she will have a reason and motivation to continue and reach her goal of passing.	2	2		2																						134	6	144	4	0	0	4.582089552238806	22.333333333333332	36	19	7	6	7	17	76	11.3	9.12	8.16	19	9.6	11.31	8.833333333333334	11.5	190
7052	10616	4	Since it is getting close to winter the geese are going south. The plants are losing there leaves. Saeng says that she will take the test again. It seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds it will give her hope and confidence. Especially the hibiscus because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother, when she first saw it and held the leaf it brought a tear to her eye. And when it comes back next year it will rejuvinate her.	2	2		2																						85	6	92	1	0	0	4.317647058823529	14.166666666666666	18	13	3	6	5	9	53	6.0	6.72	6.94	7	4.1	7.09	6.916666666666667	8.3	105
7062	10626	4	The last paragraph of the story was: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that she is adapting and that she is starting to accept the change. I think that because throughout the story she is upset and not really liking the change. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” The text says. This last paragraph seems optimistic talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning which seems like she is starting to accept the change. In my opinion, the author added  that paragraph to finish the story to show that Saeng is starting to accept the change and be optimistic.	2	2		2																						146	7	159	6	0	0	4.578231292517007	21.0	31	25	8	4	7	16	84	18.5	9.47	8.04	15	14.0	15.7	17.666666666666668	10.1	192

7075	10639	4	The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomforalable. For example when she broke down in the flower shop. This shows that even though things can remind her of home it isn’t the same. You have to get used to and become accostumed to a new place. This also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test.	2	2		2																						78	5	83	0	0	0	4.102564102564102	15.6	11	13	6	4	1	7	53	5.7	5.86	6.23	4	4.7	7.78	7.4	7.6	94

Their neighborhood is made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immagrants. The author has also made a few friends his first one being Alegria or the landlord's daughter. But the author did show some sadiness when he and his family had left Cuba. They had left friends, family, jobs and their country that they had loved. The author still listens to Cuban music when he does cook.	2	2		2																						120	7	134	3	0	0	4.525	17.142857142857142	33	13	8	2	8	15	77	8.5	7.94	7.12	14	7.6	8.17	9.0	10.3	166

In a selection from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, he describes the mood, or the feeling created by an author, in his childhood one of family and people with helping hands. Narciso says that everybody in his neighbor hood were ""immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows helpfulness espically in a time when racism and segregation were big in the States. Secondly, their was a sense of family in all of the people at Narciso's house. There was often people staying in his house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. The Rodriguez's beilieved these people would do the same thing for them in return. Finally, Narciso can not express how grateful he is to have the importance of friends and family put on him so early in his life. Without his parents stressing the fact that family is not only your blood relatives, he would never have beilived that family and helping hands were so important. A mood of family qualities and helpfulness pre vails in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir."	4	3		4																						205	10	229	8	0	0	4.795121951219512	20.5	63	19	9	13	7	27	115	11.4	9.86	7.89	31	10.1	10.93	12.8	12.2	301
7426	12174	5	A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trails, struggles, and happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family is, that its much more than blood. It's unity, friendship and laughter, its the tears, pain and heartache. Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I deal with it to, I get called cracker and n**** on a daily baised, I dont know how I would get through it without family.	2	2		2																						158	7	190	15	0	0	4.5	22.571428571428573	41	18	3	6	13	22	102	11.1	8.07	7.46	15	9.7	10.81	9.0	11.5	214
7432	12180	5	The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think thats what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up. Narciso also talked about what kinds of things happened at his house when he was a kid. One thing he talked about was how his landlords daughter was his first babysitter and first friend. He also talked about how his parents showed him thier cooking skills and thier passion for cooking.	2	1		2																						84	5	90	0	0	0	4.416666666666667	16.8	19	13	4	2	3	6	52	7.8	7.71	7.85	10	6.3	6.72	7.6	5.7	106

It is also because everyone even if they weren't related was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt every one was to him.

The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard.	2	2		2																						92	7	102	3	0	0	4.695652173913044	13.142857142857142	26	12	5	9	0	16	47	8.4	8.69	7.83	15	6.9	7.86	7.833333333333334	9.3	132
3592	5987	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drain’s a person’s energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; “The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskie’s story, “Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.	2	3		3																						149	9	168	10	0	0	4.9865771812080535	16.555555555555557	48	25	11	10	1	26	64	11.4	10.79	7.53	22	9.4	10.66	12.8	12.2	221
3597	5992	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe kurmaksie,greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided.The old cotagers told him about a path they thought was right,but was hard and did not get him to the right place.The features of the setting are described as “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.”	1	1		1																						69	3	79	3	0	0	4.76056338028169	23.666666666666668	16	10	9	3	3	10	39	36.1	11.74	10.95	14	26.7	28.76	36.5	0.0	91

3610	6005	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way. This ways are pysical and mental. The pysical ways that features affect cyclist is the terrain. If the roads are long and wiredy, this could wear the cyclist out. They could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep. When it’s you against gravity, it can be egausting. The temperature can also be a crusal factor in a cyclist pysical ability. Nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding. The cyclist and also be attracted mentally. If the terrain looks deserted or anything like a desert the byciclist instintaniously thinks “dehydration” and “death.” If some people see dead animals or bones they would think they could die. If they see vulture circling them they would get afraid and think death, but the worse thing of all is that knowing all of these things are in the same place at the same time. This is how setting affects cyclists	3	2		3																						170	12	184	3	0	0	4.576470588235294	14.166666666666666	38	20	15	6	8	21	98	7.2	8.17	7.68	25	6.5	8.5	5.555555555555555	9.3	233
3618	6014	3	"The terrain during the cyclist’s journey greatly affects him. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing. The author stated, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This shows that he was energized and happy. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, especially because he had no water left. The cyclist said, “sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn.  This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are include, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did."	3	2		3																						157	8	179	13	0	0	4.822784810126582	19.75	32	20	15	12	6	25	86	14.5	10.33	7.75	22	12.3	13.54	11.6	11.9	230
3625	6021	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty. The bumpy roods and hills make him work harder. The abandoned places make him lose hope. If faced with these obstacles I would have been affected in the same way. As I believe any human would be.	1	2		2																						60	6	66	0	0	0	4.333333333333333	10.0	11	13	5	1	2	7	33	4.0	5.77	8.08	8	2.5	5.33	4.333333333333333	6.4	73
3627	6023	3	The three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling, the towns he passes, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is important because the rougher the terrain, and the more hills there are, the more energy he must use, and the less distance he can travel. @PERSON1 is riding fine until he must travel the rolling hills which consume his energy, ehausts his water, and causes dividing hope. As he approaches towns, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be unable of giving him relief. When he pumps out water that tastes like “battery acid,” his hope once again diminishes. As he sees the bait and tackle shop, he knows he can make it there and that when he gets there he can recover. These three features are what effects the cyclist the most.	2	2		2																						155	7	171	10	0	0	4.567741935483871	22.142857142857142	33	25	9	7	7	20	91	13.0	8.83	8.69	24	11.0	12.64	20.0	11.2	210
3628	6024	3	In the story of “rough road ahead :do not exceed posted limit” the setting affected the cyclist. In the middle of the desert during the summer the cyclist was low on water. The old men gave him the wrong directions, so mainly it is the old guys thought he dies. The cyclist survives but the heat and the season he was riding he’ll probably bring another water botlle nextime	1	1		1																						69	4	74	1	0	0	4.434782608695652	17.25	21	8	4	4	2	10	32	8.1	7.71	7.47	10	7.7	8.66	8.625	8.8	95
3632	6028	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” All the road was hills and rough. Than “The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.” @CAPS1 doesn’t have that much water. That was really hard.	2	1		2																						75	7	84	2	0	0	4.76	10.714285714285714	21	11	9	4	1	17	34	8.5	8.63	7.96	12	6.8	7.07	7.300000000000001	8.2	106
3637	6033	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the main character the cyclist. The cyclist is biking “through the high desert of california in June.” So naturally it can be infereal that it is not and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases “a tarlike substance followed by brackish water” he is runningout of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that “l cald drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service causing more anxiousness and dispare l have had an experience similar to this where l wat out walking in a state park in the @DATE1. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow covered trees made me feel at if I’d never be warm again similar to He cyclist who’s environment made him feel hes wald die of dehydration. So, as can be seen. He setting of this short story affects the cyclist.	3	3		3																						190	8	203	4	0	0	4.542105263157895	23.75	58	26	15	8	5	26	90	11.8	8.88	9.39	38	10.2	12.68	11.8	11.5	271
3638	6034	3	The settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don’t want to be near when you are out of water and tired from pedaling. The time and place affected him greatly because there wasn’t a cool breeze in the air in June at California. He was in the middle of flat deserts and had no sense of where the part as and where civilization too so he can get some water. The quote “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” helped you realize taking advice of direction from old people who don’t go anywhere is a bad idea. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”. This quote shows you some terrail features that affected the cyclist. Furthermore, the cyclist realivingly found civilization with running water.	2	2		2																						136	7	143	1	0	0	4.602941176470588	19.428571428571427	38	19	6	6	4	15	71	11.6	9.35	8.13	16	9.8	11.14	14.25	10.9	185

The example is when ""he stops and asks for directions to Yosemite state park"". Because he did what to get lost. When he had to and other towns.

3647	6043	3	The setting effected the cyclist in a great way. The snakes blocked his pathways, and hi short water supply made it hard to continue. He felt as if he could drop of a heatstroke. His environment, and the information from the old man made his ride very hard to continue. All in all, his settings had a big effect on him.	1	1		1																						61	5	69	3	0	0	4.245901639344262	12.2	14	9	5	5	2	7	34	4.7	5.67	7.61	10	4.5	7.5	6.1	8.8	81
3650	6046	3	Setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty not outside causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must have. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED @CAPS1. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isn’t much easier. Anothe way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought of to be a diamondback.	1	1		1																						105	7	119	6	0	0	4.438095238095238	15.0	22	20	4	7	1	15	58	8.2	7.36	7.96	17	6.6	8.52	8.0	8.3	141
3653	6049	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist traveled miles on a bike dealing with the weather in the deserts, little bit of water, and being tired. The cyclist faced many hard times trying to travel on a bicycle from one point to another.	1	1		1																						57	3	63	3	0	0	4.578947368421052	19.0	18	7	4	0	1	8	27	9.6	8.65	9.01	11	8.3	9.0	10.833333333333334	9.7	82
3657	6053	3	The features of the setting affect the cylceist by the ground would change terrian a lot makeing it difficult to ride at the same speed the entire way. Also, the lack of water made it hard to focus.

3676	6072	3	In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. “Not two miles into the next section.” He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. “I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” It get harder and harder to continue his ride.	2	2		2																						91	10	100	2	0	0	4.593406593406593	9.1	22	13	14	2	1	15	47	11.6	8.88	8.41	16	9.8	10.88	12.375	8.8	129
3680	6076	3	There are @NUM1 features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobody’s there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist.  Furthermore he’s in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about @NUM2 or @NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobody’s around town in able to help him out or anything. Let’s say that he gets lost and he’ll need direction to get wherever he’s going well there’s nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the @NUM1 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																						198	14	216	4	0	0	4.35678391959799	14.214285714285714	39	27	10	15	10	22	124	7.4	7.19	6.37	15	6.2	7.61	4.888888888888889	7.8	257

For example, the text states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.” This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory” This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited. Lastly, the text states, “GRAPE AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP” The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. The setting’s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."	2	3		3																						127	6	147	11	0	0	4.708661417322834	21.166666666666668	42	17	6	6	5	25	64	13.5	9.35	7.76	17	9.7	10.79	13.5	8.8	170

One of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in. while he was lost, thirsty, and exhausted, he remained all the while in “The high deserts of California in June”. This shows that the temperature most of been unbearable. This would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate faster than usual. Also, the surface he was riding on had many steep hills, as it is said when he says “over one long, crippling hill,” This shows that the hills took a lot of energy to get up. And finally, the author says that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This shows that if he needed help, there was no one around to lend him a hand.

3720	6116	3	The features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist. He is going on this bike ride through the deserts of “california in June. This obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very fast. At one point he says, ‘The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed.” @CAPS1, the setting of having all these ghost towns was troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beggining to rum out of water.  The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” When your petalling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you. If he was in a different setting this felling of despair would not be      in the story.

3726	6122	3	During the cyclist bike ride the unbearable conditions changed his attitude when he firsts starts the reader can sense frustration because of the old timers and there directions. Then as he realizes that he might have enough water his attitude changes. The cyclist goes from frustrated to loving the secenery, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,” as the conditions changed to even more unbearable heat. He decided to just give up. Until he got courage and “slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” When he saw Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he realized he was safe.	2	2		2																						104	5	111	3	0	0	4.903846153846154	20.8	24	21	8	7	4	12	53	12.0	10.68	9.07	15	9.0	12.17	12.6	12.7	145
3739	6135	3	This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills. Another example would be “high deserts of California in June.” That’s saying its hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the “summer time” its very tiring. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																						99	6	105	1	0	0	4.404040404040404	16.5	21	14	8	3	3	11	58	9.2	7.78	7.01	10	8.7	8.73	11.1	9.4	134
3741	6137	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink.	2	2		2																						141	4	147	2	0	0	4.411347517730497	35.25	36	19	11	2	3	6	76	17.0	8.66	7.96	17	13.5	16.11	18.0	12.2	188

Then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweed and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by. Then at the end she came upon “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” where she decided to make decisions herself. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way except “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” which saved her from dehydration.	2	2		2																						127	6	134	0	0	0	4.3858267716535435	21.166666666666668	31	19	7	7	3	13	75	9.8	7.83	7.92	18	8.0	11.63	11.6	11.2	170

He finally got to the next town to live.	1	2		2																						91	6	99	0	0	0	3.763440860215054	15.5	21	12	6	3	4	7	54	4.1	3.88	7.34	5	4.5	6.52	6.916666666666667	6.4	107
3769	6165	3	"In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his trying biking trip through California. In the essay, he describes the weather with “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” While this @MONTH1 not directly characterice the weather, the reader can confin a clear image of the sweltering heat of a desert in the summer. When the author comes across the “ghost town” followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read “Rough Road Ahead,” his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”"	3	3		3																						183	6	199	9	0	0	4.786885245901639	30.5	47	28	7	4	5	25	97	16.4	10.46	8.51	32	12.8	15.92	15.25	13.6	261
3780	6176	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when the old guy had told him do you know where to go? An the other guy was like “ yes sir! I own a very good map” so how did it change for the man that was riding this bike he saw all of those towns an a sign that said Rough Road ahead. That the man would always stick to the future. What had change was he saw all of those buildings, town, an he was going an going. I think he might stick with the future.	1	1		1																						99	7	107	2	1	1	3.717171717171717	14.142857142857142	21	14	3	4	0	9	61	4.3	3.54	5.57	5	3.8	6.6	7.25	3.1	112
3782	6178	3	In this essay, the features of the setting cause the cyclist to become irritaed toward the old men. Ten this essay, old men give the cyclist direction, and instead of using a map, he takes their advice. However their information is out of date, and takes the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist uses all of his energy to get to unknown towns of no importance, and with no water. The cyclist blame the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy. However he showed realy become himself for taking their advice, and motuising a credited map on real directions.	2	3		3																						105	6	118	7	0	0	4.666666666666667	17.5	29	16	7	3	5	14	56	9.3	8.76	7.81	15	8.9	9.67	9.0	11.2	156
3786	6182	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summer’s day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, “.I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except “Old timers who haven’t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing” (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor. It can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting.	2	3		3																						171	9	193	9	0	0	4.631578947368421	19.0	50	18	9	4	0	23	94	9.9	8.7	7.81	21	8.3	9.47	8.333333333333334	10.3	234
3793	6189	3	The features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing. It might make you want to go faster and left out your inner speed demon. That’s all I can really tell you. Because personally I don’t think the setting of where you ride your bike doesn’t even matter. Possibly for a bicyclist it can, but to me I don’t even think so.	1	1		1																						67	5	74	2	0	0	4.298507462686567	13.4	10	12	1	8	2	10	43	5.5	6.43	7.6	8	5.0	7.15	6.5	8.2	88
3794	6190	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there are no cars, building, water, or people in sight. It goes from flat road to rolling hills. Even though he had no water he was determined to keep pedeling. “Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit” At this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation I would feel hopeless. There was no sign of hope. He just saw endless rolling hills and that was all. Then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free. So he pedeled up to the building, and that with all the others was abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die. In conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope. If he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case. He is in the middle of nowhere. He finally came to bend and say “Then, as easily as randing a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.”	2	2		2																						203	15	225	9	0	0	4.246305418719212	13.533333333333333	42	28	9	14	8	24	125	6.4	6.38	6.59	21	5.8	7.62	6.428571428571429	7.6	256
3797	6193	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun. The heat dyhydrates and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor. It takes up the time and energy he has to preform. Another key ingreedient of the setting was the desert. There was no one to help him and there wasn't a place to get water. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story.	1	1		1																						74	8	84	1	0	0	4.256756756756757	9.25	18	11	4	4	3	11	46	3.3	4.84	6.66	10	4.6	5.88	4.25	7.6	102
3801	6197	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist. One setting that affected him was the first setting. I this setting he used up his water and it was hot. this affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die. The text shoud this when it said “I could drop from heat stroke”, later when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory he thought about how thirsty he was. This affected him because usually when you think about thirst you get thirsty er. This also made him dis apointed. The finale setting affected him because he had finally got water and wasn’t thirsty. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						131	9	143	2	0	0	4.580152671755725	14.555555555555555	25	28	6	5	3	16	70	8.3	8.47	7.22	14	7.3	7.78	11.4	9.5	180
3802	6198	3	"On that long bike ride the cyclist was affected by the setting. He was affected of the lack water, the heat and the bad directions, throughout the story the cyclist ran out of water due to bad directions from some men.""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride.” I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men.” Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information. But not the land has changed and the directions were wrong. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help. The cyclist experienced how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal."	2	3		3																						194	11	207	3	0	0	4.415384615384616	17.727272727272727	51	21	17	3	6	18	110	11.6	8.25	7.12	17	10.4	11.58	15.5	11.9	266
3803	6199	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. For example, the sun was beginning to beat down. Another example, I was hitting my water bottles pretty regularly. The setting were hot and dry. It effected the cyclist very much. It was to the point of dying.	2	1		2																						48	6	56	2	0	0	4.625	8.0	11	6	2	6	1	6	27	4.4	6.22	6.34	7	5.2	5.7	4.166666666666667	9.3	73
3804	6200	3	The cyclist in this essay was a very brave man. He had many obsticles in his journey but he still made it. Nature was most definatly not on his side that day. He had to ride his bike up and down hills several times which wears you out very quickly”. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, “After he got threw the hills, he came to a sigh “ ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT”.  Now he has to go through bumply roads. “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me”. Now the poor guy had to deal with snakes bigger than him! Thankfully he got by the snake, alive. “Over one long cripping hill, a building came into view”.

3805	6201	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is hot, therefore he gets thirsty. When he says “the sun was beating on me” this shows it was hot.

3818	6214	3	Being a cyclist and in the condition he was in would be even worse in the setting he was in, such as the heat of California, and difficult condition of the path he was on. Him being so hot and tired from the difficult hilly trail would be worse with having the lack of supply of water. The author was very dehydrated and was on the verge of fainting. If it were not so hot, the cyclist would have been in a much better condition.	1	1		1																						85	4	92	3	0	0	4.0588235294117645	21.25	16	1	11	6	4	7	58	8.3	5.8	6.55	7	8.1	10.4	12.375	10.7	112

He said “sometimes life can be so cruel.” because he was running out of water, running out of strength, and running out of patience. Also a snake ""it really did look like a diamond back,” could have killed him. He was in the desert and anything could happen.

3836	6232	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting is an all- important factor. The author feels the need to describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details each place he stops, such as in “one ramshackle shed…and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule…” and “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite…” In a story such as this setting is of great importance especially since it is so rapidly changing. The story itself would be of much different quality likely for a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past, this story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is.	1	1		1																						128	4	138	5	0	0	4.267175572519084	32.75	32	12	14	7	4	15	67	20.5	8.55	8.96	17	16.4	18.33	19.0	12.5	172
3841	6237	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned “@PERSON1’s Grape Juice” factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets “old timers and the give him a “shortcut” to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their “shortcut.” While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. “It din’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.	2	2		2																						163	9	173	0	0	0	4.060975609756097	18.22222222222222	31	31	7	8	7	19	99	9.4	6.22	7.5	13	8.8	10.06	11.0	8.8	204
3850	6246	3	The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes “that the old men would have been right,had he been riding,” before the last word war.” But any “town” he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says,“It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, But “hope was fading.” Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who haven’t moved from their front porches in years.	1	1		1																						157	8	177	15	0	0	4.337579617834395	19.625	27	27	18	11	9	32	91	12.1	7.26	7.85	15	10.0	11.75	14.25	9.3	199
3852	6248	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hottnes of the deserts of California because the cyclist was sweating, and drinking his water bottles. Also when the cyclist saw the building, he thought he could rest and maybe get a ride to where he was going but, the building was abandoned years earlier so the cyclist couldn’t stop.

One feature that affects him is that he is cycling “through the high deserts of California in June”(Kurmaskie). This affect would mean that the author would be dehydrated faster. The cyclist, author, is dehydrated before he can make it to the next town because he “gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in [his] mouth”(Kurmaskie).	1	1		1																						77	4	89	5	0	0	4.9480519480519485	19.25	19	12	3	2	1	13	43	11.5	10.27	8.28	15	9.6	9.28	11.125	10.1	112

The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, “he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless” when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now “behind” him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist’s physical and mental state.

3903	6299	3	Whether the lack of water, the hills, the tumble weeds – all are things that affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water. The hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills. Finally is the tumbleweeds. The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look. When he sees tumble weeds he try’s to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn’t want to crash. The dehydration / lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive.

3904	6300	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, “I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved @NUM1). Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, “Telling myself that of I could make it that far, I’d be @NUM3).

After I crested the first few of these a large highway sigh jumped out at me,” prety much what it is saying is the flat road soon turned into rolling hills. If I was the cyclist riding up the hills my legs would get very tired and sore after a while one example, is when my friend ,@PERSON1, and I went  bike riding, we went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, in fechmisburg, and we had to ride up a big hill, so after a few pedals our legs started hurting, so we decided to just walk go the hill.	1	1		1																						128	4	144	11	0	0	4.077519379844961	32.25	32	18	11	6	4	16	73	13.9	6.22	8.55	19	12.2	13.74	12.75	8.1	160

In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to “ short, rolling hills,” which would have made it harder to pedal, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mention how the sun was beating down on him, and that would alos serve as a factor thout helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problem the cyclist faced nowever, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through.

However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The fist town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with dipleted water, @CAPS2 sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory. He had made it to a bait store for water at last. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again.	2	3		3																						121	8	131	2	0	0	4.132231404958677	15.125	31	15	9	10	3	14	67	5.6	5.5	7.26	16	5.6	6.7	6.857142857142857	7.6	154

3944	6340	3	"The story Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclist’s mood was detirmined by the setting as well as his needs and his detirmination to make it. The setting of the story early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of @CAPS1 can June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men’s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his detirmination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he’d] be fine."" @CAPS2 for the cyclist, the settings affect was negitive."	3	2		3																						153	9	185	7	0	0	4.8431372549019605	17.0	36	21	11	13	1	32	84	10.9	9.52	8.2	26	8.4	9.99	7.428571428571429	10.1	221
3957	6353	3	As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldn’t have trusted but did any way. This led him through the desert. Even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water op one will be there to save you from dehydration. Just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a roll in the cyclist feelings. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water. Every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact. For example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water. Finally just when his strength was to give out he found the bait place & water and that dramatically and a place to rest too bad there was another old man there, isn’t it?!	2	3		3																						164	10	178	3	1	1	4.152439024390244	16.4	35	21	13	15	6	14	98	6.4	6.15	7.25	16	6.1	7.99	7.0	8.8	208
3960	6356	3	SETTING WAS A IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE STORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT THERE IS A LACK OF WATER. AND ME WAS IN A BIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS.

3962	6358	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly was incorrect and he got lost. The lack of water led to the possibility to sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst. The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy.These were the affects the setting had to the cyclist.	2	1		2																						58	5	64	0	0	0	4.593220338983051	11.8	16	10	3	0	1	4	31	7.8	8.75	8.71	11	6.6	9.25	7.5	9.5	84

3968	6364	3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He can’t say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him he’ll die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and that’s like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.	2	3		3																						147	6	154	0	0	0	4.238095238095238	24.5	37	22	10	9	2	10	85	10.8	7.38	7.43	10	8.1	10.89	13.0	7.8	183
3971	6367	3	In this story, “No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, by be Joe Kurmaskie I believe the setting greatly affect the cyclist. I believe this because when it’s long downhill cool roads is fine but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he can’t keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around so the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story.

3981	6377	3	In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first “town” he is not too worried about it and moves on. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.” @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked “and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.” @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didn’t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the author’s moods.	3	3		3																						218	10	242	10	0	0	4.408256880733945	21.8	47	36	16	21	10	35	118	14.9	8.14	8.8	31	11.9	13.91	12.75	10.6	291
3984	6380	3	There are many ways the setting affected the cyclist in this story like the weather, supply of food and water, wrong estimation for old people and the road. First off the weather was was very dry and it was two hundred degrees, so it made you sweat and hard to breath. The supply of water was harsh not much around at all and when he tryed to get water the pumps would pump out not water. The weather and water supply were two maijor affects on the cyclist.	1	1		1																						88	4	95	3	0	0	4.204545454545454	22.0	24	8	6	6	6	8	53	9.4	6.67	6.7	7	8.3	9.71	11.5	7.2	113
3987	6383	3	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, “short, rolling hills”, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isn’t much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble.	2	2		2																						101	6	112	5	0	0	4.366336633663367	16.833333333333332	26	15	8	5	5	12	59	7.6	7.13	6.97	11	6.3	8.7	8.333333333333334	8.8	134
3990	6386	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel”. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “ From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part.	2	2		2																						184	11	206	6	0	0	4.2771739130434785	16.727272727272727	41	27	10	14	6	23	118	10.2	7.09	6.84	19	8.7	10.5	8.0	9.8	243
3992	6388	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 the heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.	3	2		3																						174	8	191	11	0	0	4.494252873563219	21.75	39	26	13	11	3	22	100	12.1	8.36	7.5	21	9.5	12.26	14.25	10.6	233
3995	6391	3	The setting effected the cyclist by the rough roads, the cylist having a hard time pedaling over the roads. The snake, the cyclist got scared of the snake on his ride through the “town.” The fact he was running out of water and the water he found tasted like battery acid. The setting was very rough on the cyclist.	1	1		1																						59	4	64	2	0	0	4.3559322033898304	14.75	18	7	4	1	1	7	29	8.9	7.37	7.02	5	7.4	9.24	10.5	7.8	74
4013	6409	3	There were many different conditions that effected the cyclist. He did not have the proper ammount of water for the journey witch made it difficult. He states in the story, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1 the terrain and hills made it difficult. He ran into snakes and very deserted country. But his determination led to success and arrived into a town	2	2		2																						66	6	71	1	0	0	4.863636363636363	11.0	18	10	8	2	4	7	35	8.1	9.44	8.12	13	8.4	8.92	7.199999999999999	10.4	103
4014	6410	3	"In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first “town” that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist “chuckled and moved on”, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached “the fork of sorts” twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men’s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."	3	3		3																						233	8	261	17	0	0	4.412017167381975	29.125	59	35	19	11	7	36	123	13.9	8.14	8.26	34	12.3	13.87	13.25	10.7	316
4016	6412	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you can’t see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.	1	1		1																						188	5	193	0	0	0	3.648936170212766	37.6	34	26	6	7	6	8	130	14.6	4.31	6.76	6	12.1	15.47	17.0	7.6	208
4019	6415	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, the high deserts of California affected him. Also, “Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change.” For example flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then after over coming that, “A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55. Last the author says, “Sometimes life can feelso cruel.

4029	6425	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist. “I maneuvered down the hill.” This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would hawe been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy.

4037	6433	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist more tired and thirsty. The rolling hills where he had to pedal up and down and the desert with no water in sight just dry land. Everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story. The old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory,is like drinks are right there but are now gone. If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he would’ve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings. The tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died. Everything in the story was the opposite of what he wanted until he got to his last hope the bait shop.	2	1		2																						130	8	141	2	0	0	4.446153846153846	16.25	32	14	11	8	8	12	75	7.7	7.77	7.48	12	6.1	7.75	7.0	8.8	167
4038	6434	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us “…I was travelling through the high deserts of California  in June.” The extreme heat of the summer definitely put a  strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water . Unfortonatly the  “towns” were very far apart and many not having good water making dehydration  problem. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.” @CAPS1 of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map.	2	2		2																						124	6	137	4	0	0	4.294573643410852	21.5	35	16	6	6	4	19	64	20.1	8.95	9.01	20	16.9	19.0	19.0	12.5	175
4048	6444	3	The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men’s “town” was now abandoned. “…(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled…” This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When “a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a “sad, hopeless laugh.” The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water.	3	3		3																						144	9	162	6	0	0	4.304054054054054	16.444444444444443	29	21	18	10	4	21	74	9.8	7.95	7.53	15	8.8	10.37	11.2	10.0	197

He had no water and he was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the “ghost town” and bait shop he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story.	2	2		2																						116	5	132	7	1	0	4.586206896551724	23.2	30	14	4	3	7	18	70	11.8	8.88	7.24	12	8.8	11.0	13.5	9.4	154

4061	6457	3	In this essay features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite makes it worse. Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn’t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn’t have water he couldn’t funcation as well as if he was hydrated.	2	2		2																						137	5	146	4	0	0	4.2773722627737225	27.4	28	19	12	12	4	15	80	12.4	7.43	8.45	15	10.4	12.71	10.6	9.4	181
4063	6459	3	In this story, the cyclist had to ride threw the desert, during june and with little water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates alot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him. Personally I don’t know what he was doing ride threw the dessert by himself, and that’s his problem.	2	2		2																						71	4	78	3	0	0	4.352112676056338	17.75	13	14	4	2	3	9	42	7.9	7.07	7.41	8	6.7	8.25	8.375	7.2	90
4070	6466	3	The cyclist in ”Rough road Ahead” was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 it’s usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isn’t an easy trick.	1	2		2																						126	6	138	5	0	0	3.984126984126984	21.0	23	17	9	10	9	16	77	7.8	5.28	6.81	9	7.9	9.67	11.2	9.3	161
4071	6467	3	The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says “the bulding abandoned years earlier.” If I was him I would of turned around and went back so I would take the chance of not dieing out in the middle of an abandoned area.	1	1		1																						81	5	85	0	0	0	3.950617283950617	16.2	18	12	1	1	1	6	52	7.3	5.28	7.57	8	6.5	9.11	10.375	6.0	95
4078	6474	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn’t even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. “The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.” (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.	2	2		2																						177	12	197	2	0	0	4.581920903954802	14.75	42	29	12	13	5	24	93	10.0	8.36	8.18	24	8.6	10.59	11.8	10.5	250
4080	6476	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions	3	2		3																						176	13	197	6	0	0	4.1477272727272725	13.538461538461538	38	22	12	7	9	19	113	4.9	5.44	6.64	15	3.8	6.31	5.75	6.7	213

4096	6492	3	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts olwing the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water decive his trip, but he was mistaken. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The setting affected the cyclist’s mood in a negative way.	2	2		2																						85	6	93	2	0	0	4.905882352941177	14.166666666666666	23	9	7	4	2	11	48	8.8	10.03	8.61	17	7.6	9.92	7.583333333333334	10.1	130
4097	6493	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. It stated, “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was  pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along. Also it stated,” At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down. There was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy.	2	2		2																						102	7	115	3	0	0	4.660194174757281	14.714285714285714	27	19	6	4	5	14	52	9.2	8.81	7.73	13	7.6	9.15	8.666666666666666	10.1	140
4101	6497	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead.” First, the scorching heat of the desert  in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of dehydration. In the text it states, “I could drop from heatstroke in a gorgeous day in June (@CAPS1).” This shows the effect the exposure  to heat had on @NUM1 cyclist. Also, the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story. In the text it says “I toiled on( @CAPS2).” This shows the increase in effort in strain the  terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure.	2	2		2																						101	4	113	3	0	0	4.355769230769231	26.0	33	13	5	1	0	15	54	12.2	7.9	8.8	15	9.6	11.31	13.25	8.8	135
4106	6502	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a few different ways. At first it helped him. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers” This is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun. Later on the setting was against him. There was no place to get water and he was becoming dehydrated the terrain was getting rougher. There were no people around to help him, but there was a snake. All these features were working against him until he finally made it to a bait store. This bait store gave him water and a good map.	2	2		2																						107	9	118	2	0	0	4.327102803738318	11.88888888888889	22	19	5	5	6	12	63	5.7	6.6	6.66	10	5.0	6.11	6.0	8.1	138
4112	6508	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist’s own words, “ things began well enough.” @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, “got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.” He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him.	2	2		2																						106	5	120	10	0	0	4.452830188679245	21.2	26	17	7	7	5	21	56	12.8	7.78	8.82	16	10.1	12.49	13.75	9.5	138
4119	6515	3	Setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition. If the road condition is bad then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night. If it is night, they must be careful due to cars not being able to see them. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous to cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water.	1	1		1																						81	7	92	2	0	0	4.246913580246914	11.571428571428571	18	9	7	3	1	10	51	4.4	5.43	5.97	6	4.3	5.63	5.357142857142857	7.4	107
4130	6526	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him.

4140	6536	3	Heat, water supply, energy-all are features of setting that can affect a cyclist. First, is heat. When it is too warm out it makes it more difficult, and more inconvenient to ride. Second, is your water supply. If you are riding, and begin to run low on water, your in trouble. The author describes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. If you arn’t prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Lastly, is energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. “With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” the author describes. When you are out of energy, your ride is over. all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey.	2	2		2																						150	12	178	15	0	0	4.62	12.5	31	22	9	11	4	31	88	7.2	7.82	6.94	20	7.4	7.57	4.9	9.8	219

4155	6551	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows features of the setting played that affects the cyclist in many different ways. A setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking (drinking) water, and worrying that he is going to run out. Kurmaskie writes, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in @NUM1). This is what the cyclist gets affected by throuout the whole story as he releizes he could die of heatstroke if he dosent watch how much water hes drinking. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration.	2	2		2																						122	5	136	5	0	0	4.549180327868853	24.4	29	21	9	5	2	17	62	12.2	8.71	9.12	19	10.4	12.38	14.5	11.2	171
4161	6557	3	Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking to much of his water. So when he stoped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water their. He started his ride the the roads were hilly and short. Then the road turned into bumpy to. So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way.	1	1		1																						96	6	103	1	0	0	4.145833333333333	16.0	20	12	7	4	4	7	59	6.1	6.03	6.9	8	6.0	7.65	7.666666666666666	7.8	120
4162	6558	3	The character in this short story has a most that changes with his surroundings. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said ‘’ The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,’’ As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher.	1	1		1																						64	4	67	1	0	0	4.369230769230769	16.25	14	12	4	1	3	5	39	15.4	8.72	8.92	10	13.4	16.55	19.5	0.0	87
4179	6576	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren’t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat.	2	2		2																						99	6	110	3	0	0	4.343434343434343	16.5	23	14	8	6	4	13	59	7.3	6.96	7.8	13	7.4	8.22	8.25	8.8	135
4181	6578	3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes because he couldn’t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey.	3	2		3																						92	7	103	2	0	0	4.880434782608695	13.142857142857142	26	12	8	6	0	15	44	9.2	9.68	8.86	17	8.1	9.16	8.333333333333334	10.5	139
4183	6580	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldn’t have taken the old mens advise. He explains that “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself.	2	2		2																						147	7	161	5	0	0	4.401360544217687	21.0	30	22	9	10	2	19	82	11.5	7.96	8.4	24	10.5	12.52	11.6	11.2	205

He says the sun began taking harder ran and the terrain turned into short rolling hills. The hills made him work harder which dehydrate him guccher.and since there was no water in the desert, he could have died of dehydration	2	2		2																						75	5	80	1	0	0	4.333333333333333	15.0	18	14	3	2	1	6	42	6.5	6.78	7.33	10	5.6	8.67	7.300000000000001	8.2	99

One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a deserts without a good supply of water. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the length of his journey. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist."	1	1		1																						80	4	85	0	0	0	4.825	20.0	23	7	5	4	1	5	46	11.3	10.33	7.98	14	8.7	9.5	11.75	10.7	115
4203	6600	3	In this story, the cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite, California. In the begining, the cyclist was sure of himself he decided to ask some old men that looked like they haven't been off their porch since Carter was in office for directions. The old men ended up leading him into the middle of the desert. In the desert, the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water. There was no sign of civilization what so ever. These hot conditions made the cyclist very hot, tired, and very thirsty. But that didn't stop him, he kept going and eventually he came apon a little town where he could drink cool water and take a well needed rest.	2	3		3																						125	7	141	7	0	0	4.288	17.857142857142858	25	18	10	7	5	15	76	7.7	6.55	6.8	14	6.7	9.72	7.142857142857142	9.2	164
4206	6603	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, for example, the heat was unberable beating down on him during this long ride. The fact that he had no where around him to fill up his water bottle. So he was deing of thirst and he didn’t know where he was going or how far he had to go. The setting was crushal in this story.	1	1		1																						65	4	71	2	0	0	3.9846153846153847	16.25	13	8	3	2	2	9	42	5.4	4.99	6.87	5	6.1	8.37	7.875	8.1	82
4222	6619	3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclists state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it is summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early @DATE1. And third he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together. He was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These @NUM1 things all contributed to the characters state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, that tasted like battery acid. He drank to much water at the begining which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough.	3	2		3																						167	12	182	3	0	0	4.209580838323354	13.916666666666666	34	22	13	13	4	16	102	5.4	5.97	5.93	11	4.0	7.24	5.333333333333333	8.1	205

4230	6627	3	The rider in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider “rode into the morning...with a smile” because of the bright sun, and the “cool pines” and rushing rivers”...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the “ramshackle shed...” And the “...sight of this was troubling...” to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the “crippling hills” that maybe this wasn’t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the “modern bathroom” that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through.	2	2		2																						126	6	147	7	0	0	4.5	21.333333333333332	31	13	10	7	5	30	74	15.8	8.66	8.46	13	12.0	14.5	14.5	11.2	161
4235	6632	3	Setting  depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didn’t. The cyclist  got a bad idea or aditude when he saw the towns he was upset and mad he didn’t want to die and yet he though. He was going two. He said he wouldn’t trust old men anymore. They didn’t know where were talking about .How and why did he trust even in the first place.	2	2		2																						76	8	85	0	0	0	3.858974358974359	9.75	12	17	6	4	5	12	43	2.5	3.75	6.46	5	2.8	4.36	4.428571428571429	3.1	91
4240	6637	3	The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he’s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a “ghost town” where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn’t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It’s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn’t find water yet. It doesn’t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosen’t find water.	2	3		3																						164	8	174	2	0	0	4.317073170731708	20.5	38	30	8	10	5	18	89	9.2	7.37	7.54	17	7.7	9.42	8.5	8.8	214
4241	6638	3	The setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was based in the hot, and dry terrain of California. This setting affected the character mood. It did this because some of its included feature can seem as actual metaphorically based moods. An example from the story is, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite...” this quote from the story could suggest the tone and the mood of the scenery which would be calm, and relaxed. So from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood.	2	2		2																						98	5	108	3	0	0	4.510204081632653	19.6	25	13	6	4	5	11	55	9.6	8.24	8.64	15	7.4	10.7	11.4	10.4	132
4243	6640	3	I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being a long, hot, lonely ride there, had an effect on him. It scared him which made him go longer. He had nothing to drink and thought he was going to die it made him weak. The snake in the way caused him longer and every stop that had once there effected him to.	1	1		1																						68	5	76	3	0	0	3.9558823529411766	13.6	9	14	5	4	2	8	44	4.0	4.4	6.4	5	3.9	6.03	6.0	5.7	80

4254	6651	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all he is travelling through a desert in California in June so the weather is extremely hot and the cyclist needs water, however as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water himself so he is thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, if frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot it tastes like battery acid @CAPS1, when the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, but there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, that the cyclist cannot go more that 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town. he still will have to wait longer for the much needed water, travelling at 12 mph. The snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape. Thus his major concern is the lack of water.	3	3		3																						170	8	189	9	0	0	4.323529411764706	21.25	33	22	12	16	4	13	109	11.1	7.49	7.44	19	10.4	11.13	18.333333333333332	10.0	234
4264	6661	3	In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,“The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.” This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn’t care if he died. From the author’s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																						157	10	170	4	0	0	4.273885350318471	15.7	32	26	6	11	4	18	92	8.5	6.96	8.13	20	7.4	9.88	8.166666666666666	8.8	205

The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.”The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,” in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. ”I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey."	3	3		3																						180	6	200	8	0	0	4.616666666666666	30.0	49	22	9	13	4	25	97	18.3	9.24	9.11	33	15.0	15.96	18.666666666666668	12.0	252
4291	6688	3	From the setting that affected the cyclist are possible conditions such as the weather and surrounding enviorment like hills and streams or even tyes of animals and if they are poisenous or not.

First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men who’s directions were out of date. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways."	2	2		2																						126	8	140	3	0	0	4.563492063492063	15.75	37	18	7	4	0	16	62	9.0	8.18	7.29	16	6.8	8.47	8.166666666666666	8.0	168
4300	6697	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left. The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town. The setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much.	2	2		2																						103	5	109	1	0	0	4.029126213592233	20.6	17	17	6	6	1	6	71	7.9	5.75	6.8	8	7.8	9.02	10.8	8.2	132
4301	6698	3	Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate.

4309	6706	3	The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront  nature. when he began his trip with advice from “old coggers” he “ rode out with strong legs and a smile.” As he came to the first town, he describes it as a “ghost town” having no water and no human contact for some time. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rods on. Through the miles he incountered a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps, snakes,and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his “inner spirit” and caused his dehydration to further. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation.	2	2		2																						130	8	144	5	0	0	4.488549618320611	16.375	37	17	10	2	7	23	70	10.7	8.36	8.48	18	8.2	10.22	10.8	9.3	169
4314	6711	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldn’t get water from anywhere because he was in a dessert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty camps. Second, there were short rolling hills, and rough roads which made it hard to ride on. There were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes. The heat made it hard to keep riding. And there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water.

4326	6723	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is the old timers advice of how to get some were. Than the town they told go to was a ghost town.

4329	6726	3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly effected by his surroundings. First, he described a beating sun and pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent. The setting is active just like the cyclist. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad souding corral. When these old, forsaken things one mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair.

4330	6727	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting is able to affect the cyclists emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways. As the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved showing positive influence but the pump oozes a shine like substance he referrs to as tasting like “battery acid” changing his mood for the worst. Finally, the pebbles he puts in his math show is desperation and willingness to try anything to survive show a new posotive outlook on the desert until a pump “lodges are in his thro at” making yet another negative influence. All of these feature lead him on his way to “Gary and will fish camp” and grounded an extra boost on his journey through the desert.	3	3		3																						159	5	165	1	0	0	4.515723270440252	31.8	42	18	14	7	9	15	82	15.8	9.3	8.99	25	13.3	14.23	14.75	12.7	222
4343	6740	3	In this story it is clear how difficult the cyclists journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions, lack of water, rattle snakes and fear of dieng. However he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. “This shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When finding this building to be abandoned, and all things, juice, anyone use would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination. And it paid off in the end he found his water and survived.

4359	6756	3	The main features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the fact that it was June and the dessert heat. “… I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June….” (kurmaskie @NUM1). This helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of California dessert. This affected the cyclist by his dehydration and the fact that he was inthe middle of no where with no one to help him. This is how the month of June and the dessert heat affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																						92	6	101	0	0	0	4.0638297872340425	15.666666666666666	29	7	3	1	3	10	52	9.6	6.45	7.18	8	8.7	11.37	13.25	10.7	115

This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, “This sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me” (Kurmaskie @NUM3).

4367	6764	3	Each new feature of the setting in the essay entilled, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the cyclist in some way. For example, in the text , when the narrator stated that he had to avoid a “ ridiculously large snake “crossing the road, he became more aware of his surroundings and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until he finally abided the large reptile. Also in the text, when, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” hope was replenished into the cyclist. This hope allowed the narrator to because more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building. Eighther for better or worse, a few feature of the setting arrives and affects the cyclist every step of his journey.	3	2		3																						133	5	147	12	0	0	4.646616541353383	26.6	36	18	11	7	3	21	68	13.8	9.41	8.18	21	11.2	12.38	14.5	10.4	187
4370	6767	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. First since he was in a desert, the heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his journey to the parts. Also, the bumpy roads and rolling hills slowed the bike down to 12 mph since it was to extreme for him to handle at high speeds. When he sees the fist building because he fist is relived but soon after he loses all his hope because it is desserted. Even the old men that living in the area have an affect on the cyclist because they give him out-dated directions that almost @CAPS1 him. Because of this, he will probably rest first an old man’s short tentS again. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						128	7	140	3	0	0	4.3359375	18.285714285714285	26	16	6	12	2	13	78	8.2	7.31	8.0	14	6.9	8.88	11.0	8.8	167
4378	6775	3	The setting was a hot desert in California that a biker got stuck in going to Yosemite National Park. These settings were hard on the cyclist. For example, he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed. He was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off. All of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though. He learn that just because they are old and looks wise they have information probably older than the artifacts at a museum. Besides he has a trust map: He got a lot from this trip.	2	2		2																						110	7	119	1	0	0	4.1909090909090905	15.714285714285714	24	16	8	3	3	9	62	6.2	6.26	7.0	15	5.9	8.83	7.142857142857142	8.8	142
4384	6781	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting the cyclsit is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. “But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because has eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. “After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read:ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challamging for the cyclsit. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, he’s relieved.	2	2		2																						199	12	225	11	0	0	4.457286432160804	16.583333333333332	44	33	14	10	1	32	109	12.0	8.13	7.89	27	10.6	11.97	14.5	10.4	272

4405	6802	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because it’s hot, and than theres no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” (@NUM1.). This exert from the test supports my previous statement about how it’s hot because the speaker tells us how he’s sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage. “There was no one insight not a building, car, or any structure of any kind” (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance.	2	2		2																						127	6	145	3	0	0	4.25	21.333333333333332	31	18	5	5	4	17	78	14.6	7.32	8.7	15	11.0	13.66	17.333333333333332	8.1	158

The features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. The setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. In the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. These have been what I believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist.	2	3		3																						207	10	224	7	0	0	4.1980676328502415	20.7	43	27	24	2	13	16	121	8.7	6.62	7.26	19	7.8	8.86	7.833333333333334	7.9	259
4410	6807	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the person who rode the  bike was very tired his legs and body needed a rest after riding on his bike for @NUM1 miles into the pedal. Also it effected the cyclist because of all the riding he had to do struggleing to get where he was trying to get but he was a strong man and he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling. He was also restless but he did it.	1	1		1																						84	5	88	0	0	0	3.9647058823529413	17.0	18	12	4	3	4	6	55	11.4	5.93	7.66	10	10.7	12.63	15.0	8.8	111
4413	6810	3	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappoint, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally when he passes a portrin the road with nothing but a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral…” he becomes disturbed.  The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, “doing a water-deleting @NUM1.” The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, “ironic twist” the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist.	3	2		3																						142	6	159	8	0	0	4.736111111111111	24.0	38	18	11	8	4	23	74	18.9	10.46	9.29	28	16.0	16.45	19.0	13.4	212
4414	6811	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit.” In the beginining when the cyclists had just begun his cycling cause he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says “the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. “ When he says this the reader imagines someone in an ??? more excited as ??? ??? ??? ??? his destination on a dry day.  As the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what ?? ?? then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen when the cyclist says, “I wiped the swear from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage and that not to get too excited” the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall as the setting changes to “burning sun” and extremely hot, with a shortage of water the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upheat. For example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states “with only luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting.	3	3		3																						219	11	243	3	0	19	4.404545454545454	20.0	50	30	13	13	5	25	117	21.3	9.24	9.09	30	17.5	19.04	18.666666666666668	13.0	300
4416	6813	3	The feature of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described which implies that the biker probably had a hard time half way through the story he said, “Flat road was replaced by shor, rolling hills.” He said this to describe the difficulty in this race. It also makes it seem exciting because it changes things around. It wouldn’t be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didn’t show the terrain change at all.	1	1		1																						87	4	93	3	0	0	4.540229885057471	21.75	21	16	6	6	1	10	45	14.5	9.18	8.89	10	11.1	12.52	15.833333333333334	9.7	116
4421	6818	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point.	3	2		3																						160	5	171	6	0	0	4.4125	32.0	41	24	6	6	5	16	88	19.3	8.48	9.17	28	16.5	17.25	26.5	10.1	218

4429	6826	3	The features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony. As the cyclist continues down his path he pasts through a ghost town, then twenty mile up the road he sees a ramshackle shed & some rusty water pumps. He attempts to get water out because he was runing out but all he could get was muck, then what he described as “water feeling two-hundred degrees, it had the flavor of battery acid. Further down the road was a sign that said rough road ahead, adhere to the posted speed limit of 55, he was going 12 mph. Even worse he found an abandoned juice factory on the way, at that point he was out of water.	2	2		2																						118	5	131	6	0	0	4.203389830508475	23.6	32	17	3	6	2	13	65	10.2	6.97	8.31	15	8.9	9.7	12.75	6.7	148
4434	6831	3	After reading “Do not Exceed Posted Limit” I have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who tell him a bad shortcut. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. “that mood” was replaced by short, moving hills.” The cyclist could not er nuertecy tried everything, not showing how long he have to continue going up and down. There at one point he says, “@CAPS1 can feel so cruel.” There, he is upset because a road sign come up through acid tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also. When you take a short cut in life, there are always consciences as you decide to drop out of high school is go on how with your journal, where is always the posibility of is not working, and where you cry with no diploma ?? and he gets a job	3	3		3																						205	10	223	10	0	2	4.195121951219512	20.5	37	36	12	15	6	27	116	13.0	7.15	8.49	24	11.1	13.21	14.5	10.0	264
4440	6837	3	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become deyhdrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water.	1	1		1																						104	7	116	3	0	0	4.413461538461538	14.857142857142858	26	14	4	6	3	11	63	6.8	7.13	6.5	12	7.9	8.27	7.2857142857142865	9.2	152

4449	6846	3	Many features of the cyclist’s surroundings effect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor cycles, or even buildings. It’s like he’s on the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won’t hit any thing. The fact that he’s alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident.	1	1		1																						71	6	82	5	0	0	4.52112676056338	11.833333333333334	19	9	6	6	3	15	38	5.8	7.18	8.22	11	4.4	7.54	5.75	8.3	92
4450	6847	3	To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would about @NUM1° outside and sunny. You can’t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move in the snow. You can’t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could getin a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you be able to ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride.	1	1		1																						117	6	126	2	0	0	3.8547008547008548	19.5	21	16	12	5	5	10	73	6.5	4.64	5.82	2	6.2	7.8	10.2	6.4	136

4452	6849	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park, thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town. The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store. If it hadn’t been so hot, if the “towns” along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadn’t been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the affore mentioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																						184	10	201	7	0	0	4.586956521739131	18.4	50	26	13	12	3	21	93	9.4	8.76	8.24	32	8.1	9.53	8.666666666666666	9.4	259
4454	6851	3	The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one. He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long  in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the author’s terrain. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with.

4458	6855	3	The features of the setting put an affect on the cyclist. The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds, and a ridiculously large snake. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play.	2	2		2																						78	4	86	4	0	0	4.576923076923077	19.5	19	10	6	2	2	8	46	9.9	8.65	7.03	10	7.4	10.88	11.75	11.2	104
4459	6856	3	One main feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the heat of the day. If you ride a bike in the heat of the day, you are going to use up a lot of water. Another factor is the limited supply of water. The final factor is the wrong directions from the aged men. Aged people aren’t always wrong but their info.

The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. He described this with sentences like “Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water.

4469	6866	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the “high deserts of California”, making a hint that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he must’ve been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the sun beating down on him. Second, he began to ride through hills, and as common sense would be used, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle especially up hill, and it wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water must’ve tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water. As you can tell, the difference in setting plays it’s crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply.	2	2		2																						133	5	150	11	0	0	4.661654135338346	26.6	31	18	10	7	7	20	71	13.8	9.29	8.4	22	11.3	12.75	14.25	10.8	186

4482	6879	3	In the story, the rider faced several meloncholy sites. For examples the “ghost town” that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for futher directions or somewhere to freshen up. Futher on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obsticle that he had to go over. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back. He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him.	3	2		3																						122	7	130	1	0	0	4.0	17.428571428571427	20	21	7	8	3	12	83	6.1	5.22	6.44	10	6.5	9.58	8.666666666666666	10.3	157
4490	6887	3	I think the features of the settings affect the cyclist because the knowledge of the cyclist is limited example, “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office”, meaning now its time for the older people to relax and watch of younger people.	1	1		1																						48	1	53	2	0	0	4.854166666666667	48.0	15	7	3	1	1	5	24	25.4	11.27	11.61	12	19.6	20.87	26.0	0.0	68
4491	6888	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,” That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.” This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																						193	10	209	6	0	0	4.221649484536083	19.4	39	28	13	6	7	18	116	10.6	7.09	7.45	22	9.1	11.09	13.0	9.5	252
4508	6905	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. It does because the road is not in good condition and he has to travel a long distance with the bad weather.

4531	6929	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road ahead; Do not Exceed the speed limit” affected the narrator in many ways. The first thing that affected his ride was the heat. at first he didnt really notice but then it began to slow him down. Then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride, the roads went from flat sheet to short, rolling hills.” The road change and the heat made him say “I could drop from heatstroke.” Then because of the old towns he went through he was unable to get water. The water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality.	2	2		2																						113	8	122	2	0	0	4.150442477876106	14.125	27	15	9	10	3	13	64	12.2	6.56	7.42	11	9.6	12.38	13.5	9.5	140
4533	6931	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist’s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.	2	3		3																						161	11	177	5	0	0	4.6521739130434785	14.636363636363637	37	19	17	12	3	24	88	8.5	8.81	7.87	26	7.2	8.18	6.0	8.5	230
4537	6935	3	The features of the setting in the essay affected he cyclist because first of all he lisined to old fowks that hav’nt left their front porch in about ten years. Then he didn’t ask someone elses apirean on where to go and how to get there. His worsed mistake tough was not trusting the map he had with him the howl time. If he would have just trusted his map and not when with when the old fella said he wouldint have almost died of heat stroke.	2	1		2																						87	4	91	0	0	0	4.114942528735632	21.75	16	14	6	6	2	11	55	8.8	6.33	8.35	8	7.1	9.18	11.125	6.0	102
4543	6941	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didn’t bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer way. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling. Moreover, it was a June day and in June the days are hot with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated. This is how the setting affected the cyclist	2	2		2																						130	6	139	4	0	0	4.323076923076923	21.666666666666668	22	21	7	9	4	10	82	9.8	7.37	7.51	15	9.4	11.14	12.0	11.2	179
4551	6949	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a “run-down” rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.	3	3		3																						135	9	151	5	0	0	4.311111111111111	15.0	34	19	13	5	5	15	78	6.4	6.43	6.49	13	5.6	7.78	6.714285714285714	8.5	178

4566	6964	3	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One reason was that he was in the desert. Like in the quote “through high deserts of California. This means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke. Then he couldn’t even get any water. Like on the quote “of the rusted water pump.” it was describing how old it was then the cyclist got some out but it tasted like old battery acid.

4591	6989	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling”, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a “modernized” town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."	3	2		3																						151	8	173	11	0	0	4.503311258278146	18.875	36	26	11	5	7	26	80	9.2	8.01	8.23	23	7.1	9.94	11.8	10.1	199
4598	6996	3	The features of the setting is that it is hot and dry. The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets very hot and he drinks almost all of his water and he only has about @NUM1 sips left when he gets to the other town. It also effects him because he had an advantage. The advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up. So then he had a time to get cool. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind. Also when the cyclist was thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth.	2	2		2																						117	7	124	0	0	0	3.7948717948717947	16.714285714285715	20	16	8	8	3	8	80	4.8	4.06	5.95	6	5.1	7.02	7.833333333333334	6.9	143
4605	7003	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include:- the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first “town” he found he described as a “ghost town” It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly and [he] was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road [being] replaced by short, rolling hills wasn’t helping either. The terrain really affected the ?? he had to exert in order to keep going, along with being dehydrated the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals. During his journey “a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority of the ?? “which  ?? him it could have ??

4615	7013	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist tremendously. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles until he passed through the flat round, that was replaced by short rolling hills. He said and I quoted “I toiledon” he sounds like it’s hopeless, that he wasn’t going to make it.

4620	7018	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes “that road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road. The speed limit is also affect the cyclist. When the the speed limit sign is appear, the character feels “life can feel so cruel” (kurmaskie @NUM1). It tells us that character can not do what he is trying to do. The bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist.	1	2		2																						99	7	113	3	0	0	4.474747474747475	14.142857142857142	32	14	6	1	1	14	46	6.7	7.13	7.21	11	5.2	6.45	6.785714285714286	8.0	133

4624	7022	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist is many different ways. One way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out. Since the cyclist is getting worn out he needs to drink more and more water. Now that he’s drinking more water his running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it. Then when he starts to use less water to conserve it until he gets to the next town he starts to become dehydrated and more tired and he starts to feel weak. Also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired. It also starts to get hotter and he gets thirsty more often. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																						133	8	141	0	0	0	4.157894736842105	16.625	18	25	14	13	8	9	81	6.5	6.2	7.07	12	6.2	6.94	7.666666666666666	6.0	167

4627	7025	3	The setting in “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits” affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on “there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.” At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out.	2	2		2																						107	3	113	3	0	0	4.252336448598131	35.666666666666664	36	10	4	0	3	14	58	16.4	7.44	8.21	14	13.7	15.78	18.666666666666668	11.2	141
4630	7028	3	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” affect the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The fact that there was nothing around him, made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he’s going to die. He shows that he’s lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from “old-timers who haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving.	3	2		3																						145	7	159	6	0	0	4.296551724137931	20.714285714285715	37	24	4	5	4	20	79	10.9	7.32	7.12	14	9.2	11.06	10.4	8.8	183
4631	7029	3	At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey, is just beginning. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles “battery acid.” The terrain begins to feel like more of a hill, which makes the struggle even worse. The cyclist is drinking water more now, and is becoming tired. He comesto a rough road and says, “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative affects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride, a snake blocks his path and he becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of water in the restroom. The water is a feature @NUM1 the setting that refreshes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unknown area are features that make the cyclist feel lost and tired.	2	2		2																						195	8	214	13	0	0	4.4512820512820515	24.375	44	33	18	10	12	22	98	13.5	8.19	8.34	27	10.6	12.8	11.0	10.3	259

The old men thot “haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office” told him a shortcut that he followed and ended up almost killing him due to heat stroke and dehydration.

4671	7069	3	The features in the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affect the biker. For example, the heat is constantly drying the biker out. Also, at the first town the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause with water tastd like “battery acid”. Even after that were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit. The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along ride. The pebbles that he found helps him out. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip.

This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. “a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist.	2	1		2																						110	4	115	2	0	0	4.545454545454546	27.5	34	15	3	0	2	14	58	18.3	9.3	9.48	21	15.2	15.77	18.0	10.5	150

He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and it’s wrong. The man figure that out halfway through the story.

There is anther feature the effects the cyclist, and that is no one is around for miles. If he died out there, no one would no know for days. I know this because in the story he said “ There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. ''That says it all, the last feature is that it was hot.

Joe writes, “Things began well enough… flat roads…” This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a “smile on the face.” (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next “town”. Finally, when the author reaches “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp” he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, “know The best way to get There? “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude.	2	2		2																						172	13	196	8	1	1	4.565714285714286	13.461538461538462	44	35	15	8	5	36	78	8.3	8.47	8.56	25	5.8	7.6	6.714285714285714	8.3	227

However, there were many problems with this idea. First of all, blimps themselves were not very sturdy. Strong winds could easily blow dirigibles trying to dock into the spires of other buildings. Dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than Helium. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable. The smallest the sparking could set the whole blimp ablaze. The docking system its self was also a problem. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side. One concern was that a way could fall off and fall into the densely populated city below. This could've proved very disastrous!	3	3		3																						130	12	147	4	1	0	4.8	10.833333333333334	36	15	13	11	2	15	72	6.6	8.62	8.3	24	5.1	6.78	5.0	8.8	185

Secondly, they had to design a few special floors for the passengers of the dirigibles. One floor would be for baggage and suitcases while a special observation deck was set up for passengers to exit or enter the ship. Lastly, the building would now be 102 floors and would need to be very durable so special materials were needed to be brought in and used to create the building.

The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose due to many reasons and many obstacles. One of those many reason was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Furthermore the biggest obstacle to the sucessful use of morning mast was nature itself. Due to the reason that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe. The other obstacles was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

The idea failed parially due to the impracticality of docking a @DATE2 foot balloon filled with flamable gas to a city building. The mere size of this glimpse was astounding and this created many problems. Firstly The wind atop a skyscrapper is great and inconsitent. It is extremely difficult to dock to a building a seen when the Los Angeles tried to dock in @DATE1. The balloon was unable to dock due to potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city. The blimps were also kept afloat by Hydrogen which due to its chemical nature is extremly flamable. Blimps had exploded in the past such as the Hindenburg. Engineers knew that if a similar accident occurred at the Empire state Building, substantial damage would have been done to the city and building itself. These impracticalities combined with the use of airplanes rather than blimps gaurenteed no blimps would ever be docked to the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																						177	10	189	1	0	0	4.875706214689266	17.7	50	23	16	8	4	18	86	10.4	10.21	8.71	34	9.0	11.6	9.0	11.4	261
8965	14915	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One of which being that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used Hydrogen to float, making them very flammable and unsafe. If a blimp were to be damaged over New York, many people could be hurt. Also, nature itself made docking extremely difficult. Winds made the blimps very unstable. If one were tied to the mast, winds could wrap the line around the mast. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any ship to even approach the mast.	2	3		3																						111	8	123	4	0	0	4.783783783783784	13.875	29	18	10	5	1	11	59	8.0	9.16	8.88	22	6.4	9.52	7.857142857142858	10.4	159

Firstly, the thousand foot dirigible would attach to the buildings by a single cable, adding stress to the frame of the building. The builders were forced to modify and strengthen the foundation to address the issue of stability. similarly, builders had to deal with the issue of wind pressure which were constantly shifing at heights of over @NUM1 feet in the air. The load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit pressure and stress onto the buildings foundation. This was a high safety concern, and pivotal to the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the empire state building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders faced significant obstacles such as building weakness, safety, and law enforcement, that made attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State's mooring mast, virtually impossible.	3	3		3																						177	8	196	10	0	0	5.141242937853107	22.125	56	26	12	8	4	19	81	15.4	12.19	8.73	35	12.0	13.28	12.2	13.3	272

Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front to the back. The architects could not drop a mooring mast on top of the building. A one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be to heavy for the buildings frame. In order for it to work it would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework. Another obstacle was safety. Dirigibles out of the United States contained helium meaning it was highly flammable. If an accident would occur like in Lakehurst, New Jersey then a lot more people would be harmed considering downtown New York was densely populated.

This would cause any dirigible attempting to dock swing around and below in the wind, which poses many safty risks for passengers going on and off the zepplen. The dirigible could also puncture its frame on nearby buildings while attempting to dock, which also causes safty risks for people on the building and on the ground. Have a zepplen attatched to the building also made it structurally unstable and modifications had to be made the frame of the building to give it more support.

Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety.

9057	15007	6	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. So Al Smith thought putting a mooring mast at the top of the building, would allow dirigibles to dock there several hours. It would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off. Another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored. It would be held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. Third obstacle would be using hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen it is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																						176	10	192	6	0	0	4.670454545454546	17.6	50	24	8	8	6	14	101	9.4	8.99	7.92	28	7.8	9.54	10.166666666666666	11.4	253

Which was forty-six feet taller, than the Empire State. Which led to Smith making the State Building reach the height of 1,250 feet. This leads to another obstacle, he wanted to add a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. This didn't work due to lack of landing space. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would cause stress to the buildings frame.In conclusion I just explained the obstacles of the Empire State Building.	1	1		1																						108	8	126	4	0	0	4.836363636363636	13.75	40	16	4	1	0	13	55	10.8	10.21	8.48	15	8.0	9.05	8.666666666666666	10.1	149

How to dock a dirigible to the side of a building was one of the biggest concerns, but the amount of stress this would cause was an even bigger worry.  But the greatest obsticle to this project was the wind, nature itself.  The fear was that the wind would blow the dirigible into a neighboring building, and tethering the dirigible was not an option for safety reasons.  Due to the architect's inability to overcome these obsticles the Empire State Building was never used for it's original purpose.	2	2		2																						117	5	133	5	0	0	4.710743801652892	24.2	37	11	7	2	4	14	69	59.9	11.4	12.68	21	47.7	50.56	12.0	0.0	178

They also had to have wenches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. The architects also needed to install housed elevators and stairs bring passengers down to the base floor and back up. After the renovations were done to be empire state building it had 102 floors. After the building was done the owners found out that they could not let dirigibles on to the building.

Also another obstacle was the pedestrians and other buildings around. Most ballons were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable.

This evidence explains that if the mast was to be place the builders would have to strengthen the entire building so there would be no problems with the mast"	1	1		1																						159	5	170	2	0	0	4.69811320754717	31.8	46	21	4	4	4	7	92	16.6	10.17	8.29	27	13.3	14.98	19.666666666666668	12.7	220
9285	15235	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building is located in the densely populated New York City. Therefore, if the dirigible dangled high in the air above those people, it would surely be unsafe In addition to the safety aspect, one of the greatest obstacles was nature. The violent winds on top of the building are always shifting due to the air currents, therefore, it would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, thus making it illegal for dirigibles to ever fly up to the building.	3	1		2																						114	6	126	7	0	0	4.798245614035087	19.0	32	13	7	12	0	11	60	12.6	10.22	8.92	25	11.0	12.28	12.0	12.0	172

First obstacle discovered was ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (Lüsted). This was an issue because hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch on fire in New York, thousands of people would be hurt/killed. The greatest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind changed constantly and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to danger on the streets. The dirigible would be dangling over the pedastrians (Lüsted). One other reason was a legal reason. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building Two tried and neither of them were successful. The constructors of the mooring mast were oblivious to these issues at the beginning, than realized them after. The Empire State Building could not be used to land dirigible due to the fact that non-U.S dirigibles used Hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach."	4	3		4																						216	11	245	8	0	0	4.861111111111111	19.636363636363637	53	28	20	14	4	22	125	11.3	10.15	7.83	35	9.8	11.17	10.833333333333334	12.7	319
9296	15246	6	In the Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. To dock, a moor mast was necessary. One could not simply Place one on the empire state building because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add stress, which would force more modifications to the frame costing upwards of sixty thousand dollars. The mooring mast was not completed mainly because of safety. After the combustion of the Hindenburg, owners of the Empire State Building realized a disaster it would cause if it hapened in New York. Nature was also an obstacle, with constantly changing violent air currents threatening to move the dirigible, which could not be anchored down as it could be in a field. It was a risk not worth taking. Lastly, a law passed earlier prevented dirigibles from even approaching buildings on such elevation over urban areas. These were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	4		4																						187	10	207	9	0	0	4.983957219251337	18.7	53	27	9	10	1	20	95	11.4	10.97	8.62	39	9.4	12.19	10.166666666666666	12.3	286
9298	15248	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirt dribbles to dock there was, if they dropped the mooring mast on the top of the building they would have strengthened the frame because of the wind pressure, and pressure from the single cable. Also most dirigibles from out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. Another problem was that New York is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building on to citizens down below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if that could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around. They also suggest using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger. The last obstacle faced with the fact that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas.	3	3		3																						185	8	196	3	0	0	4.616216216216216	23.125	46	23	12	11	3	11	111	11.9	9.46	8.11	30	9.9	11.83	19.333333333333332	11.2	255
9299	15249	6	When the builders of the @ORGANIZATION2 took on the difficult task of building a mooring mast at the top of the structure for dirigibles to dock at, they faced various obstacles that made it difficult for them to carry out their plan. One of the first obstacles they were faced with was the fact that they couldn't just slap a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The huge dirigible that would be held by one cable tether would add an immense amount of stress to the building's frame and fandation. The builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building. The main problem the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure were the safety issues. Dirigibles (aside from the @LOCATION1) mostly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and increases the risk of fire. Since the blimps would be above thousands of pedestrians of the city, the risk of a blimp catching fire was much too high. On top of that, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always Shifting due to the violent air currents, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. Although Al Smith had a great vision for docking blimps at the top of his building, the reality was that it was unrealistic, and the bulders were faced with too many obstacles for it to work.	3	3		3																						239	10	260	6	0	0	4.640167364016737	23.9	68	26	16	10	3	20	141	12.4	9.35	8.13	38	10.3	12.57	15.25	12.0	331

9317	15267	6	The plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building encountered problems from its introduction until its conclusion. The first problem was the original design of the building. The original design did not include a dirigible docking station. When plans for the station were introduced, the building was not strong enough to carry the heavy load of a spire and a dirigible. To adjust, an additional @MONEY1 were spent in order to ensure the building would be structurally sound during a dirigible docking. The next problem became imminent after the Hindenburg's fire: any hydrogen-filled dirigible that caught fire at the Empire State Building which cause significant damage. Moreover, because many dirigibles used hydrogen, the safety risk was significant. Wind proved to be another obstacle. The force of a dirigible being blown around by heavy winds could prove to be too much for the structure of the building. Moreover, because any dirigible docking at the building would be one thousand feet off the ground, there was no way to anchor the dirigibles. The fact that many tall spires lined the @LOCATION1 skyline presented an imminent danger to any dirigible trying to dock. Finally, one of the most significant problems of building a dirigible docking station was the fact that law prohibited low flying aircraft in urban areas.	4	4		4																						218	12	241	7	0	0	5.174311926605505	18.166666666666668	61	26	27	8	1	22	111	12.0	11.77	7.8	35	10.4	10.4	11.0	12.6	353

The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

The architects thought that heavy weights could be put onto the ends of the blimps, but they then realized that that would not be safe for pedestrians walking below Also, the building had to be a ceetain number of feet high, in order for the airship height rule to be eliminated. If it was not an something exploded, the heavily populated city of New York would be in grave danger.

9371	15321	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public.	4	4		4																						241	11	260	7	0	0	4.626556016597511	21.90909090909091	68	29	12	9	8	18	136	11.3	9.11	7.8	29	8.3	10.59	11.2	10.0	316

Having an up to @NUM1 foot blimp is full of flamable nitrogen hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. One accident and tons of lives would be at stake. Especially after the German blimp the Hindenburg crashed, workers knew, had that happened in New York their death tolls would be huge.Along with the extreme perels that the builders knew would be at stake, mother nature would also not make it easy for dirigible to dock at the empire state building. The winds atop the building were constantly shifting. The air currents were too violent and posed to many threats for danger. Even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge. Lead tools can be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging above tons of people this would not be a safe idea.Overall the idea of having a dirigible connected to the empire state building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost.	3	3		3																						198	11	216	5	0	0	4.51	18.181818181818183	55	23	16	10	4	17	106	11.0	8.65	8.4	29	8.3	11.43	12.0	10.5	267

The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems in docking these aircraft. If a blimp was to explode in downtown New York, it could be a disaster. Another obstacle that would be faced is nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were coming around. These would make for docking the airships to be illegal. The idea for making the Empire State Building a mooring post was an engineering feat but the actual usage of it was not practical.	3	3		3																						132	10	146	2	0	0	4.878787878787879	13.2	40	15	10	5	1	13	69	8.2	9.56	9.2	32	7.3	9.83	6.75	10.4	196

So, with the time thay had, they assumed that they fixed the problem, but when it was finished the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fufil it's purpose..."" Most of the problems didn't arise from the building but the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big crowded city, such as the highly flamable hydrogen that fills most dirigibles or the closeness of the other buildings to the blimps could cause them to burn. Overall the idea was good in theory, but could never be excuted. Only two dirigibles ever docked their and it has never been used since"	3	3		3																						197	8	222	10	0	0	4.700507614213198	24.625	52	27	15	9	7	21	110	13.0	9.52	8.38	30	10.5	12.28	12.0	11.7	280
9524	15474	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigibles, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the tops of the building it would add stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress. The cost of the modifications was over sixty thousand dollars. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. This was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building was unsafe. This first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the United States, used hydrogen into helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast. All these challenges along with an existing law they did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there.	4	4		4																						228	10	244	5	0	0	4.780701754385965	22.8	59	29	14	8	3	13	131	12.5	10.33	7.75	32	9.8	11.75	8.666666666666666	11.8	326

9536	15486	6	When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, big problems became apparent to them that caused complications in docking dirigibles. One factor was that by law, dirigibles couldn't be that low above the city, as they could accidently  crash into a building and fall onto the crowds below. Another factor was the air currents around the tall buildings, especially the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the winds would violently rock it, and could crash against the building and fall to the streets below. A recent factor arose when the Hindenburg dirigible burst into flames from the hydrogen in it when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. Nobody wanted to risk that happening over New York City, either. So because of flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and by law, the builders had complications when building the mooring mast to allow dirigibles to land there.	3	4		4																						170	7	190	12	0	0	4.830409356725146	24.428571428571427	52	18	9	10	4	16	90	13.6	10.51	8.19	23	11.6	12.31	14.75	12.0	249

9539	15489	6	"@ORGANIZATION2's article The Mooring Mast"", explains the many problems with using the peak of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles. First of all, dirigibles that travelled internationally were filled with Hydrogen, a very flammable gas. Having another Hindenburg-style disaster over New York City would be very dagerous. Also, the winds at the top of the spire are rapidly changing and unpredictable, making an approach dangerous. It would normally be okay for a blimp to land in a windy area, because lead weights could be fastened to ropes holding the blimp down. Without landing on the ground, such as just attaching to the spire, there was no way to weigh down the blimp to stabilize it. Finally, a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas, making a docking at the Empire state illegal. Many practical reasons crushed the dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State."""	3	3		3																						150	8	173	10	0	0	5.053333333333334	18.75	45	21	12	11	1	20	75	11.7	11.14	9.2	32	9.4	11.25	10.333333333333334	11.9	225

The news of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in flames greatly concerned the owners of the Empire State Building. They imagined how much more worse that would be if a dirigible combusted on the building and in a dense population of Downtown New York. This caused the builders of the Empire State Building to reconsider allowing dirigibles dock at it's mooring mast.	2	2		2																						114	6	124	2	0	0	5.184210526315789	19.0	36	13	9	5	1	10	56	12.5	12.18	9.29	26	10.7	11.46	10.333333333333334	12.2	181

With the use of hydrogen, the dirigibles are highly flammable. This would have created a dangerous situation ove a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The final obstacle the builders @CAPS2 was the wind. The winds at that height were extremely strong. Chapter @NUM1 it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would create a dangerous situation for the ship's passengers.

9664	15614	6	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to moor there were, the framing of the building and the height of the building and where passengers would land and dock. The frame of the building was important because if a thousand feet dirigible were to moor at the top of the building, it could add stress to the building's structure and frame and transfer it all down to the building's foundation. Wind pressure and directional change would also push the dirigible according adding more stress *** to the building.The building was at first designed to be @NUM1 floors, but to allow a dirigible to dock there and the load and unload passengers it needed more room and more height The building needed an observation room and a boarding area. When the building was redesigned the building reached to 102 floors and on the 101st floor it was an observation room doubled as a boarding area.The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles for the design of the attempt to allow dirigibles to moor on the roof including adding height to the building. The foremost problem though, was the framing of the building. It needed to be strengthened and in doing so it would allow a dirigible to moor on the top with no issues to the structure of the building.	2	1		2																						227	9	245	4	0	0	4.668122270742358	25.444444444444443	67	29	12	5	13	13	129	19.7	10.28	8.23	28	15.6	16.67	19.666666666666668	12.7	317

9672	15622	6	When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled.	3	3		3																						208	10	227	6	0	0	4.5625	20.8	49	27	17	13	1	19	125	10.4	8.65	7.63	29	9.0	10.82	10.5	11.8	294

These obstacles were very difficult to solve.      In the dirigibles, there are filled with hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flamable if the dirigibles caught on fire. It is also dangerous to be above a very densely populated area because if the dirigible ever failed, it would fall on inocent bystanders.

One of these problems, (that was noticed after building of the Mooring Mast), was how difficult it would be to keep a blimp steady and attached to something without pulling the building over on itself. Another issue was safety and one thing that was unsafe about it was that most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable. One more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably.	2	2		2																						102	4	111	3	0	0	4.833333333333333	25.5	24	10	10	5	2	8	63	14.1	10.57	8.31	16	10.9	12.55	14.25	11.2	144

9923	15873	6	While building the mast for dirigibles to be able to dock their, the architects neglected to see many flaws that were waiting to happen. First off it was against the law to have air craft fly that low to the ground. Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so having that fly above a heavily populated area would not be to safe. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object. In conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen.	3	3		3																						120	5	129	4	0	0	4.566666666666666	24.0	26	18	9	10	1	8	70	12.1	9.06	7.98	19	10.3	12.27	14.5	11.6	169

Although they did achieve there goal of height, the true purpose of the building was never used.The building was supposed to serve as a holding dock for these new air Ships called dirigibles. However this was not the case. There were reasons that were apparent before it was ever builtOne of the greatest obstacles was nature itself The winds at the top of the building were too strong for the dirigible to be safetly secure. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, and trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical. Another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. But two ships did try to land. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles failed in landing because it was too dangerous. In the end, the Empire State Building never served as a station for dirigibles.	3	2		2																						174	12	188	3	0	0	4.485714285714286	14.583333333333334	44	19	13	9	3	15	103	9.5	8.41	7.95	24	8.5	9.33	11.0	9.7	236

Constructed in the 1930s the Empire State Building was originally built to exceed the height of the Chrysler Building; it was going to stand at a whopping 1,250 feet tall. What added to this building's height was its great mooring mast that stood atop the building Dirigibles, very similar to balloons, were gaining popularity in the aviation world. However, there were many issues that held back the progress of this project. Most of these issues were safety problems. One practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was because of an existing law against airships flying too low to urban areas Another reason was the flammibility of these ships. Most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the ship exploded many civilians and passengers would be killed.

New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was wind. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speed. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties.

The next problem was lack of a suitable landing area They decided to put an anchor on the top of the building to secure the dirigibles when docked. The anchor was a winch at the top of the building but the violent winds at the top of the building would not allow the pilot of the dirigible to get close enough to the ancor because of fear that the dirigible might be speard by a nearby building.

They were faced with many architectural, @CAPS1 and nature based dilemmas. When designing the mast, they realized they could not just place the mast on top. The wind pressure mixed with all the stress of the dirigible being held by one cable would send the stress throughout the building, and even down to the foundation.

Initially, the Empire State Building was built only for inside use, so the mast would add stress to the buildings frame and possibly damage it. Secondly, the Empire State Building was built in a very densely populated area so if any malfunctions were to occur such as the Hindenburg in 1937, many people could be killed down below. Another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and they were very strong as well so any dirigible mounting on the building was threatened by swiveling and flying off when landing. The masters in the architectural era had made a true mistake when they planned the construction of the Empire State Building, and it never could have reached its potential for many obvious reasons.	3	3		3																						164	6	178	8	0	0	4.945121951219512	27.333333333333332	42	21	11	15	4	14	89	15.5	11.2	8.84	31	12.8	14.58	15.5	13.0	241

10291	16241	6	In the beginning the use of dirigibles seemed like a good idea. They could be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed it showed signs of problems. The engineers planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of stress to the building's frame. They next found that safety was an issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was flamable. Also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street. With out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel in the air with a possibility of puncturing its shell. Finally there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. There was high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end they had more cons then pros.	3	3		3																						180	12	195	2	0	0	4.605555555555555	15.0	46	24	12	10	3	14	104	7.8	8.34	7.8	27	6.8	8.44	7.7142857142857135	10.3	250

There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream.Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas.

These three main obstacles where the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircrafts. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it'd spin around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast.

Most of the obstacles should have been realized before the mast was even built.One of the obvious obstacles was the constant change in wind. The back of the blimp would not be tied down therefore swinging around in the sky. Another, obstacle would be the design of the mast. This was important because if designed wrong the mast would put stress on the building and could cause a lot of damage. Their was also a law about airships flying too low in urban areas, New York being an urban area. One of the most dangerous reasons was that some blimps were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable.Al Smith and his architects should have realized and discussed these issues before constructing an unusable structure.

10545	16495	6	In this excerpt The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstical was to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building, but they overcame that with the desion to add a top or a hat to the building. They then had to accomidate with the new situation that new modifications had to be done so that the dirigible would not add stress to the buildings frame, since the steel frame of the building could not with stand the load and wind pressure that would transmitt nearly @NUM1 feet below. The biggest obstacles that led to the fate of the mast was the fact of, since most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was very flammable, and they could not have any accidents taking place above downtown New York. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle though because, of the constant shifing winds. The dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but with them dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not safe or practical. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

According to Lüsted, this would have caused the back of the dirigibles to ""swivel around the mooring mast,"" which would not have been ""practical nor safe."" @CAPS2, there were legal issues the builders faced. There was a law at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas.

10607	16557	6	The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State went through many obstacles. They would first have to modify and strengthened the buildings frame to accommodate this new situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State building would never work. The greatest reason was saftey. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930's the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes.	3	3		3																						208	12	228	3	0	0	5.038461538461538	17.333333333333332	58	28	15	13	5	17	112	11.0	11.13	8.44	44	8.9	10.96	10.166666666666666	11.7	320
10617	16567	6	Building just a building alone is a tremendous job for builders, then adding on a docking mast for dirigibles makes it significantly more difficult.
